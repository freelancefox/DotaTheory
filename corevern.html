            <h3>Why Wyvern?</h3>
            <div class="row padded">
              • Wyvern is overpowered as a hero and yet still underutilized as a pick: no one
                has played her as a core hero competitevely—not even once. Why could this be?
                Well it probably has to do with the fact that she's such a good support. Let's
                start by taking a look at a few of the oft-overlooked reasons why Wyvern makes
                a good core:<br>
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div class="row padded">
              <h4>Stats</h4>
              • Wyvern has among the best stats in the game, with the fourth highest total stats
                at level 1 and the sixth highest total stat gain per level:<br>
              <div id="stats1" style="margin-right: 8px;"></div><div id="stats2"></div><br>
              • Add to her excellent stats <img src="img/winter_wyvern_arctic_burn.png"> Arctic Burn's
                underrated potential as a right-click damage steroid: not only does it grant
                Wyvern the <a data-toggle=?tooltip" title="That's 1000—Sniper only gets up to 950">longest attack range</a>
                in the game, it also grants her the <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="0.1, though her base attack point, 0.25, is behind only IO, Gyro and Sniper">lowest attack point</a>.
                Without much farm she can become a potent semi-carry, itemizing
                to abuse her long range and slows for massive kiting potential.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div class="row padded" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;">
              <h4>Flash Farm</h4>
              • Splinter Blast <img src="img/winter_wyvern_splinter_blast.png"> is
                among the highest DPS (damage/cooldown) AoE nukes in the game,
                making her an excellent flash-farmer and pusher.
              <div id="blast"></div>
              • With 1200 cast range on Splinter Blast, Wyvern has the potential to safely farm even
                the most dangerous lanes (not to mention jungle stacks). Giving Wyvern this kind of
                space means she has the time to see how the game plays out, adapting her items for either
                control, damage, or defense as the situation calls for—all with equal aptitude.<br>

            <h3>Synergy & Counters</h3>
            <div class="row padded">
              • A farmed Wyvern guarantees that you'll have clutch Cold Embraces
                <img src="img/winter_wyvern_cold_embrace.png"> and
                Winter's Curses <img src="img/winter_wyvern_winters_curse.png">—both
                long-range spells but which can sometimes be wasted by an
                underfarmed Wyvern who gets caught out. Having a core Wyvern is
                like having a farmed Enigma, Beastmaster, Magnus, Batrider, etc:
                it guarantees you a won teamfight if you get their spells off.
                She especially excels against BKB carries and physical damage:

                      <p>
                        If you're looking to open a draft with Wyvern, Dark
                        Seer is the perfect combo pick both because of the draft
                        ambiguity the combo creates and because of the way their skills
                        combo. Dark Seer enjoys the dual slows coming from Arctic Burn
                        and Splinter Blast to run people down, plus the Vacuum into
                        Winter's Curse followed by Wall of Replica is DEVASTATING.
                        Meanwhile, a Wyvern/Dark Seer opening always leaves you with
                        the ability to flip Wyvern from a support to a mid position—
                        definitely the biggest potential benefit of the Corevern build.

                        Yeah, sure—Wyvern is also a pretty good counter to Troll.
                        But as far as core Wyvern is concerned, Troll ult is one 
                        of the best damage steroids she can get. Free attack speed
                        plus a tank to play off of Cold Embrace and Curse. Beastmaster
                        fulfills a similar role (as do Ogre, Invoker, and Arc Warden)
                        but doesn't fit into the Draft with Wyvern quite as well.
                        Troll and Wyvern as a 1/2 can seriously control physical hard carries.

                        As far as supports go, few buff Wyvern's offensive capabilities
                        like AA does. Ice Vortex can amplify Splinter Blast during
                        the laning stage, Chilling Touch with Arctic Burn provides intense
                        ranged harass, and later on Ice Blast onto Winter's
                        Curse is an easily won teamfight. Picking the combo early
                        probably isn't advised, but if you do the enemy may assume that
                        you've just picked your two supports, hopefully leading them
                        to waste some bans and letting you get the support of your choice.

                        Phoenix is perhaps the single best wombo combo a Wyvern can hope
                        for—the Phoenix Supernova into Winter's Curse: Moltres and
                        Articuno. Wyvern mid with Phoenix offlane is a fairly risky
                        combo due to their low armor, but could definitely give your
                        team a strong early/mid game.

                        Drow lineups are considered very risky these days,
                        but this is a totally unexplored and I think very strong
                        combo. Safelane Drow with early aura points to secure last-hits
                        for Wyvern and another ranged core can lead to some
                        very snowbally early pushing. Drow is inherently squishy
                        and vulnerable, both of which Wyvern can supplement via
                        Embrace and Curse respectively. Heroes with similar
                        damage boosting auras, like Luna and Vengeful, can also
                        fill the role, though not during the crucial laning
                        stage.

                        Oracle is in a weird place right now, but as far as defensive
                        supports go there's really not much competition as far
                        as synergy with Wyvern goes. Fate's Edict plus Cold Embrace
                        makes an allied hero completely invulnerable and heals them,
                        allowing Oracle to save his ultimate for that clutch dispel
                        or to drop a heal bomb. His strong ranged harass would pair
                        nicely with the aforementioned Drow combo too.

                        Viper is a NASTY hero to lane against as practically anyone,
                        and Wyvern is no exception. His high base damage will force
                        you to attempt some CSing with Splinter Blast before level
                        3, which is usually only reserved for a lane you're far behind
                        in. Viper's potent slows can ruin your escape plan, which is
                        usually just, "FLY OVER THOSE TREES" or "FLY OVER THAT CLIFF".
                        Lastly, Viper is an annoying target to Curse, since his
                        orb won't affet his allies if he's a secondary target, and
                        he's generally too tanky to burst down during the Curse if he's
                        the primary target.

                        This tidbit used to be about Storm Spirit in 6.84, but now
                        that he received a nerf to his lane-presence AND late-game,
                        Storm isn't nearly as big of a threat as Queen of Pain. Her
                        large burst nukes will always make going for a clutch Cold
                        Embrace dangerous, plus in lane it means you'll have to play
                        quite carefully. If QoP goes heavily into the Dagger harass,
                        leveling Cold Embrace early on may be necessary simply
                        to stay healed up and safe. Keep in mind that you out-damage
                        her at level 5, but once she hits 6 you're vulnerable to being
                        burst down. If she doesn't have ult up and you can make her waste
                        Blink, you can definitely get the kill in lane. As the game
                        progresses, early Orchid is an excellent item to hunt QoP down
                        and potentially force her to commit for a defensive item
                        (which you can then 1-up with Winter's Curse after she uses
                        her BKB/Eul's/Linkens).

                        As with any intelligence hero, Wyvern gets gutted when you

                        may be a good core, she's not going to far all that well
                        against our friend the glowing pony. In pubs you'll find
                        the matchup winnable, but as skill levels rise the matchup
                        favors Leshrac more and more, since you're a sitting duck
                        for stuns during Cold Embrace and it also doesn't block
                        Leshrac's most potent spell, Lightning Storm. The only silver
                        lining here is that if you play defensively and remain
                        somewhat far back, a Wyvern with Soul Ring can safely
                        sustain in lane against Leshrac indefinitely while farming
                        with Splinter Blast. She may not get as much CS as normal
                        and lose some EXP while backing to heal with Embrace, but
                        with proper play Wyvern should avoid dying.

                        Silencer is a terrifying opponent both in lane and in late-game
                        teamfights—a fact that pretty much every hero must face.
                        Wyvern is not especially vulnerable, since she can counterplay
                        Last Word by using Cold Embrace on herself, but the Glaives
                        harass is especially hard to deal with without a proper escape.
                        Your best hope is that he doesn't burn too much of your mana with
                        Curse, allowing you to punish him when he gets near creeps.
                        Late-game, attempt to counterplay the Silencer by initiating on him,
                        rather than the other way around.

                        Lina is the other most devastating meta mid against Wyvern,
                        since her high spell damage in lane and longgg attack range
                        give her a significant advantage even in matchups of equal
                        skill. Laguna Blade goes straight through Cold Embrace, even
                        without Aghanim's, thus you really need to watch who you heal
                        during counter-ganks. A clever Wyvern can outmanuever the
                        Lina during the mid-game by using Arctic Burn and initiating
                        from interesting angles, but, in general, just having a Lina on
                        the enemy team will always make your life harder.

                        the "Hey mepo, kill urself" button in Meepo games. If your

                        deserves to lose if Wyvern is in the pool.

                        about her: she counters physical damage hard. PA is the one
                        hero archetypal of this effect—if your enemy picks Phantom
                        Assassom and Wyvern is still in the hero pool, it's pretty
                        much a must pick. Cold Embrace destroys the PA initiation,
                        and by extension any hero with a similar effect (Windranger,
                        Clinkz, Ursa).

                        not as completely as when the slow from Arctic Burn went
                        through magic immunity. Instead, Wyvern is now relegated to
                        <i>just</i> nullifying Omnislash with one skill point,
                        and stunning him through magic-immunity any time Jugg goes in otherwise.
                        There's really only one counterplay for a team with Juggernaut
                        looking to avoid getting wrecked by Curse: Linken's Sphere.
                        Lotus Orb is pretty goqop against Wyvern too, but your team

                        Back in 6.83 I started running this build when Sniper was
                        popular, and Wyvern was even stronger. The Sniper vs. Wyvern
                        matchup is surprisingly one-sided mid—in favor of the Wyvern.
                        This advantage extends the whole game, as I found through experience,
                        thanks largely to the fact that you can out-Sniper the Sniper
                        due to your longer range (1000 vs 950), free Eye of Skadi,
                        and significantly better flash-farming ability. The BKB-piercing
                        disable doesn't hurt either. Or the heal to save yourself.
                        Or the fact that you can come at him over trees. It's really
                        not even a winnable matchup for the Sniper if you play it right—
                        he should be relegated to farming from his high-ground and hiding.

                        Along with PA, Sven is perhaps the nastiest hero to catch
                        in a Winter's Curse. Watching the Rogue Knight go rogue
                        and bash one of his allies' heads in is always so enjoyable.
                        Make sure and wait for him to pop God's Strength before
                        Cursing one of their squishy supports.

                        While the SF versus Wyvern matchup mid is actually fairly
                        even, late-game it really begins to favor the Wyvern if
                        she keeps up her farm. Shadow Fiend seriously relies on his
                        BKB—sometimes to ult or sometimes just to hit people—but
                        there's really no way he should be getting an ult off against
                        Wyvern. Hang back until the Shadow Fiend goes in, then turn
                        the fight by healing whoever he went on and stopping his
                        ult with Curse. In lane, just remember not to stand still
                        for a Cold Embrace while in range for Razes. Until SF gets
                        his first few stacks of Necromastery, you'll actually
                        have the damage advantage, and thus should be fine against
                        an SF mid unless already at a skill disadvantage.

                  There are some cases when Splinter Blast may be preferable at level 1,
                  to get guaranteed CS in lane if you're saving for a Bottle or straight
                  rushing Soul Ring without a Null Talisman, and RARELY you might need Cold
                  Embrace to save your own life or an ally's, but generally if you're
                  trying to establish lane dominance 1v1 Arctic Burn is your scariest
                  skill. The instant you see your lane opponent, say hello by taking 34% of
                  their health—plus as many souped-up right-clicks as you can—and get that
                  Burn on cooldown.

                  primarily to maximize CS, but secondarily attempt to hit your opponent
                  as many times as possible. Make sure and place the initial projectile—the
                  one that deals no damage—on a full health creep if possible, so that you

                  In some games you may have to level Cold Embrace earlier to sustain yourself

                  before your Soul Ring arrives. The combo of Soul Ring→Splinter Blast→Cold
                  Embrace will keep you healed up, give you 2 free CS and set you up for 1-2 more

                  is your single biggest contribution in a fight—if you're not getting it off,
                  itemize to stay alive first and foremost.

                  Leveling up Cold Embrace significantly increases your chacnes of surviving
                  if things go South and you need to embrace yourself. It's okay—it happens
                  to the best of us sometimes. Just remember that the first point is the biggest
                  value, since it DOUBLES in effect. Further points double again, but at a 50%
                  and 33% incremental increase respectively, so there's no good argument 
                  for taking more than one additional point in Embrace before maxing Q and W.

                  Finally your ranged mini-Black Hole/Roar reaches its maximum 3.5 second
                  potential—at this point you should hopefully be controlling most of the
                  teamfight initiations, and winning fights for your team single-handedly
                  with enough luck. If your enemies are skilled enough to avoid clumping AND you
                  can't gain an intelligence/vision advantage with which to get the jump
                  on them, then play defensively, use Wyvern's superior counter-push to
                  hold high-ground, or fight around Roshan. Force your enemies to clump
                  up one way or another.

                          While rushing Maelstrom may be a slightly more stable build, the

                          end in a death, though the best situation would be if you can sit
                          in lane until taking the enemy's T1 tower with your Necro 1.

                          Sometimes the marginal benefit of 1250 gold for Necrobook 2 or 3 
                          would be less than the potential benefit of saving up for a Maelstrom.
                          Consider sandwiching smaller items like Maelstrom, Blink 
                          Dagger, Urn, etc in between your Necronomicon upgrades.

                          Wyvern is a <i>slow</i> hero—not to mention she needs to
                          be at every fight she can if you're bothering to make her
                          a core. For these reasons alone Boots of Travel are game
                          changers on Winter Wyvern, but especially in light of her
                          abilities as a flash-farmer and split-pusher. The 70-second
                          cooldown on Teleport Scroll just won't cut it if you're
                          going to put heavy pressure on the enemy as a Corevern.

                      Picking up 1-2 extra Sage's Masks can really help with your early-game
                      mana management—plus they can be used to build several other useful
                      items (especially if you're going Orchid later). If your game starts to
                      look bad, going for some of these small, incremental items can help you

                      Blink can be an extremely key item for getting off those clutch Curses
                      and Cold Embraces—but in games where you aren't having trouble getting
                      off your spells or getting caught out, it can be preferable to continue
                      straight into more damage or utility items instead. Blink is never a
                      bad idea, however, especially if you can save your own life with it
                      even once by blinking out of a bad situation. Be sure to make the most
                      of your blink reveal by catching your enemies out with a big surprise
                      initiation.

                      This is it. Refresher is the single best item on Wyvern. Double
                      Winter's Curse is nearly guaranteed to win a teamfight on its own,
                      especially in games with farmed enemy physical damage cores. You
                      should default to Refresher AND turn to it when all else fails,
                      especially because it combos so well with other beneficial active
                      items like Blink, Sheepstick, BKB, etc. The huge amount of mana regen
                      it provides is yet another reason why Refresher is an attractive
                      early pickup on Wyvern—moreso than perhaps nearly any hero in
                      the game.

                      If you really want to play Wyvern as a carry, Daedalus is the first step.
                      No other item will give you as much bang for your buck—and there are
                      few things scarier than a Corevern spitting 500+ damage crits at
                      1000 range. Once you have Daedalus, all you need is attack speed.
                      Be careful about building Wyvern for damage if the enemy has aggressive
                      heroes that can easily get in her face—the damage build leaves her
                      relatively squishy unless she goes Necrobook, Assault Cuirass or Skadi.

                      Most heroes only purchase MKB to counter evasion heroes, but
                      Wyvern is a rare hero who has good reason to purchase it otherwise.
                      Being able to stun enemies with the MKB mini-bash 1000-units
                      down the field is a very valuable ability, especially against,
                      for example, lineups with channeling abilities. Don't underestimate

                      Night vision is already a specialty of Wyvern's thanks to the bonus
                      vision from Arctic Burn, but by adding Moon Shard she can initiate
                      from an even longer distance at night. Moon Shard provides the highest
                      attack speed in a single slot with none of the downsides of Mask of
                      Madness—making it by far the best option for affordable damage after

                      In games where killing structures quickly is going to be a priority,
                      Wyvern can offer more to the team by itemizing tanky and participating
                      more aggressively in pushes. While Wyvern may have a sick strength
                      gain, even a platemail-based item like Cuirass won't make her strong enough
                      to truly "tank". Make sure you walk ~100 units towards your target
                      to get the Cuirass aura (900 range) on them.

                      Mjollnir would be a great Wyvern item—if she were a hero that tries to get hit.
                      While she does make good use of the attack speed, the active ability
                      is usually wasted without a teammate like Axe to throw the static
                      charge on, and thus Mjollnir is not usually the most cost effective item
                      choice until you're nearly six-slotted.

                      There's really no other stats item Wyvern would want, plus
                      the Skadi effect can be extremely effective at kiting
                      enemy carries. Wyvern already excels against enemy physical
                      DPSers, but with Skadi's additional 35% movespeed slow there's
                      little they can do to escape once they come in range.

                      physical damage carries. If you get behind especially Medallion
                      of Courage is a good early survivability item, so consider turning

            • The above table shows Wyvern's TI5 winrate in relation to both player
              role (position usually played by player) and farm priority (end game ranking by net worth, 1-5).
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div class="row padded" style="padding-top: 8px;">
            • While the most effective role for Wyvern at TI5 was hard support, observe
              in the highlighted rows above that there was also a slight increase in winrate
              in games where Wyvern outfarmed her offlaner.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <h3>The Solution: Versatility</h3>
            <div class="row padded" style="padding-bottom: 8px;">
            • With such a low winrate, can captains really justify Wyvern as a continued tier-1 
              pick/ban? Adding core Wyvern to your arsenal gives you the ability to safely draft her early
              without giving away any information about your lanes.<br>
            <h4>Pick Rate by Role</h4>
            <div id="current" style="margin-right: 8px;"></div><div id="predicted"></div><br>
            • As players start to realize just how versatile Wyvern can be, I predict she will
              see play on every role, from offlane to carry. She remains a strong 5-position,
              but with her combination of reliable early farming into late-game teamfight control,
              many former greedy support-Wyvern players will transition into playing her as a core.
