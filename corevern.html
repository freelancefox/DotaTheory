              This page chronicles my attempts to utilize Winter Wyvern as as
              core hero—an idea I think has merit competitively because it
              would give the hero a new edge in drafting. While she may never
              be stronger as a core than as a support, I think there will
              definitely be a point, whether through meta shifts, new item
              builds, or buffs/reworks, where Wyvern will be used as a core
              commonly. Maybe that time is now. I aim to constantly update this
              guide as Wyvern and the meta change. If there's one thing to
              remember here: don't try to shoehorn a Corevern into just any
              lineup! Half the effectiveness of Corevern is its drafting
              possibilities, including surprising your opponents and picking
              insane cheese strategies like Drow, Troll Warlord, Bloodseeker,
              etc.

            <h3 style="padding: 8px 0;">For New Players</h3>
            <div class="row padded" style="padding-bottom: 4px;">
              Wyvern herself is a somewhat tough hero to learn—her E and
              ultimate are both unforgiving spells—but the upsides of the hero,
              especially as a core, are vast. I would highly recommend learning
              to play the hero traditionally (as a support) first. Once you
              have a couple games of that under your belt, picking up Corevern
              is a lot more like learning to play any regular mid hero with a
              ranged attack and nuke, a bit like Windranger, Shadow Fiend, etc. If
              you're looking to offlane with her, playing offlane Wyvern is a
              bit like offlane Zeus, Rubick, Leshrac, etc: not really a thing,
              but still seen from time to time—heroes who use a spell to CS
              while staying barely in experience range.

          <h3>Auroth, the Winter Wyvern</h3>
          <h4>Radiant, Intelligence</h4>
          <img src="img/Winter_Wyvern.png"></img>
          <h5 style="color:#304A46;padding-top:4px;">Support / Disabler / Nuker</h5>
          <div id="lore" class="row padded">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
              Auroth the Winter Wyvern is primarily played as a support, but
              thanks to her versatile kit—utility, spell damage, and even
              physical damage with some items—she can really fill any role the
              team needs. She really doesn't <i>need</i> items to play an
              effective, though sacrificial, 5-position support, but with
              proper itemization can become a fearsome damage dealer from any
              other role. She has the longest attack range in the game and
              a very long range on her spells as well: Her Q, Arctic Burn, is a
              temporary steroid that provides that long attack range, burns
              away enemy health <i>and</i> provides a free Eye of Skadi-like
              slow effect, combined with flying movement like Batrider's
              Firefly (though with no flying vision). Her nuke, Splinter Blast,
              is costly and cannot damage a lone enemy, but offers among the
              best damage and lowest cooldown of any AoE nuke in the game.
              Wyvern's next spell is her heal, Cold Embrace, providing a save
              against physical damage while healing up your ally, but
              preventing them from moving or acting. Finally, her ultimate,
              Winter's Curse, is perhaps the least important but highest
              skill-cap spell in her kit, allowing a strong Wyvern player to
              shine by finding clutch saves, kills, and setups. It freezes one
              enemy while making any nearby allies attack their teammate—the
              catch being that it also blocks damage from your own team. With
              careful spell usage and a clever gameplan, you might find Wyvern
              is a hero well-suited to both a greedy support AND supportive
              carry.

            <h4>Lore</h4>
            <p>
              Like many great poets, Auroth just wants time to write, but the
              Winter Wyvern's life is full of interruptions. The epics of the
              Eldwurms have a long and colorful history, but some fear that the
              remaining dragon scholars are not as prolific as they once were,
              with few lines added to the Eldwurm Eddas since the last age of
              greatness.  Auroth laments: "We forget that there is more to life
              than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live our
              lives in the pursuit of creative expression." She embarks on
              research expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all
              this research can be terribly distracting, and she spends less
              time writing than she should.  Although she knows she should be
              lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas, she finds herself
              engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She loots
              castles, raids ancient libraries...  and if she happens to heap
              glory on herself in the process, she tells herself that it's
              merely a side effect of her research. The fact is, while her
              skill and power on the battlefield are legendary, her scholarly
              travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of literary acclaim.
              But she is not content to stand as a protagonist of heroic lore.
              She wishes also to create it.

                still has always been underutilized as a pick: no one has
                played her as a core hero competitevely—not even once. Why
                could this be? It likely has to do with the fact most people
                think she doesn't have enough to offer as a core. Let's start
                by taking a look at a few of the frequently overlooked reasons

              • Wyvern has among the best stats in the game: out of 113 heroes,
                she's tied for seventh highest total stats at level 1 and also
                tied for the fifth highest total stats at level 25:<br>

              • Add to her excellent stats the underrated potential of Arctic
                Burn as a right-click damage steroid: not only does it grant

                in the game, it also grants her the

                With the right items she can become a potent semi-carry,
                focusing on attack speed in order to deal as much damage as
                possible during Burn's duration.

              • Wyvern's <img src="img/aghs-upgrade.png" width="24"></img>
                Aghanim's Scepter upgrade, added in 6.87, also removed
                the one thing truly holding Wyvern back from being
                a normal carry in the true sense: a carry whose steroid
                is only available 30% of the time isn't much of a carry!
                The obstacle now is itemizing to support its 40 mana per
                second cost.

              • Splinter Blast is among the highest damage per second AoE
                nukes in the game, making her an excellent flash-farmer and
                pusher:
              <div id="blast"></div>
              • With 1200 cast range on Splinter Blast, Wyvern has the potential
                to safely farm AND harass even the most dangerous lanes (plus
                she can clear jungle stacks). Given space in a lane and some
                mana regen, core Wyvern can build for surprising damage,
                mobility and control, with the potential to itemize defensively
                and a useful +120 GPM level 20 talent to back it up.

              • A farmed Wyvern guarantees that you'll have more clutch Cold
                Embraces and Winter's Curses—both long-range spells but which
                can sometimes be wasted by an underfarmed Wyvern who gets
                caught out. This build emphasizes the importance of positioning
                and the right items to make sure that never happens.

              • When played as a Core, Wyvern functions similarly to ranged
                damage dealers like Drow, Sniper, Windranger and OD, hanging
                back in fights and itemizing for mobility to survive.  Wyvern's
                niche is her flight over terrain, her BKB-piercing control
                spell, AND her heal, which allows her to sustain herself in
                lane, save allies from physical damage and aid in pushing.

              • Wyvern is well-rounded but you need to fill in the
                gaps in her kit with items. The thing missing from support
                Wyvern—which sets Corevern apart—is damage items.

                        Picking Wyvern in general always excels against enemy
                        heroes that rely on physical damage, especially when it's
                        the enemy's main carry. This fact persists regardless of

                        thing about her: she counters physical damage hard. PA
                        is the one hero archetypal of this effect—if your enemy
                        picks Phantom Assassin and Wyvern is still in the hero
                        pool, it's pretty much a must pick. Cold Embrace
                        destroys the PA initiation, and by extension any hero
                        with a similar effect.

                        from Arctic Burn used to go through magic immunity.
                        Instead, Wyvern is now relegated to <i>just</i>
                        nullifying Omnislash with one skill point, and
                        stunning him through magic-immunity any time Jugg
                        goes in otherwise. There's really only one
                        counterplay for a team with Juggernaut looking to
                        avoid getting wrecked by Curse: Linken's Sphere.
                        Lotus Orb is pretty good against Wyvern too, but your
                        team still gets Cursed.

                        Ursa is perhaps the single hero in the game most

                        lane, so long as you stay away from his slow
                        Earthshock, you won't even need to rely on Cold

                        all good purchases here. If Ursa gets support, make
                        sure you get Soul Ring ASAP and stay back as far as
                        possible while getting experience and farm. Splinter
                        Blast's range (1200) is just under that of exp range
                        (1300).

                        Drow relies entirely on physical damage—and hates
                        getting caught out of position. Even though she's quite
                        long-ranged herself, Drow is easily shut down in a fight
                        by Cold Embracing whoever she goes on, OR using her to
                        kill one of her teammates with Winter's Curse. In lane
                        Drow has a pretty sizable advantage here thanks to her
                        range, despite the recent nerf to Drow's base damage
                        making hers comparable to Wyvern's. Overall, this can
                        be a close matchup 1v1. Use your nuke a few times off
                        cooldown to force Drow back (you have to hit her
                        though), and Cold Embrace gives you the sustain
                        advantage as the Wyvern player. Make sure to get Boots
                        and potentially Phase Boots ASAP.

                        with detection and possibly an early point in Cold

                        Back in 6.83 I started running this build when Sniper
                        was popular, and Wyvern was even stronger. The Sniper
                        vs. Wyvern matchup is surprisingly one-sided mid—in
                        favor of the Wyvern. This advantage extends the whole
                        game, as I found through experience, thanks largely to
                        the fact that you can out-Sniper the Sniper due to your
                        longer range (1000 vs 950), free Eye of Skadi, and
                        significantly better flash-farming ability. The
                        BKB-piercing disable doesn't hurt either. Or the heal
                        to save yourself.  Or the fact that you can come at him
                        over trees. It's really not even a winnable matchup for
                        the Sniper if you play it right—he should be relegated
                        to farming from his high-ground and hiding.

                        Terrorblade's meager healthpool, compared to Wyvern's
                        actually quite sizable one at level 1, means that this
                        is actually a way easier lane than you think.
                        Especially if TB wastes his Metamorphosis trying to
                        harass you, only for you to heal it off. Just so long
                        as you start battering him with level 2 Splinter Blasts
                        at level 3, he'll be forced back from the lane to heal
                        at the least.  That's enough of a win for a hero like
                        Wyvern, so long as you follow through with a gameplan
                        that involves using that lane pressure to snowball and
                        push so TB can't.

                        Phantom Lancer's illusions aren't that threatening
                        before they can replicate on you while you're Cold
                        Embraced, but after level 6 you might want to be wary
                        of letting his illusions wail on you. The Spirit Lance
                        spam isn't as troubling for Wyvern as for some heroes,
                        since she has sustain from Cold Embrace, but keep in
                        mind that as the game goes on your advantage in this
                        matchup will slip. Unless you have a Magnus on your
                        team to give you ranged cleave with his Aghs, you're
                        never going to be able to scale a Wyvern as hard with
                        farm as PL can push his illusions to be tanky. For that
                        reason, as a Corevern you absolutely want to take
                        advantage of this relatively easy 1v1 lane to shut down
                        an enemy core and begin snowballing through early
                        towers. Coordinate with your team!

                        resist), you can never discount the fact that Wyvern's
                        ultimate becomes the "Hey mepo, kill urself" button in
                        Meepo games. If your enemy is brave enough to pick
                        Meepo anything but last, he deserves to lose if Wyvern
                        is in the pool.

                        The spiderlings Broodmother spawns with her nuke aren't

                        level 3 (hero level 5), so really this lane comes down
                        to detection once again, allowing you to trade ranged
                        harass on the Broothmother while she probably targets
                        you with her summons early on. Some armor might help in
                        that regard, otherwise just make sure you don't get run
                        down and surrounded. Don't let her have a boots

                        insignificant due to Maelstrom procs.

                        As far as 1v1 lanes go this one isn't bad, although
                        Naga's somewhat high base damage and high movement
                        speed do mean that you can't do much about denies
                        early on. Once you have the nuking power of level 2
                        and level 3 Splinter Blast, things will turn in your
                        favor. In the meantime focus on not getting caught out
                        by Ensnare and an enemy support rotation (if she skills
                        it). Once you get Maelstrom Naga can't really push a
                        lane until she has Radiance and perhaps some stats, but
                        hopefully if you're following this guide you won't let
                        her get too fat before trying to end the game. Also

                        Chaos Knight illusions are among the toughest for
                        Wyvern to clear out, but luckily there's only one of
                        them early on. The best plan of action against CK is to
                        avoid getting caught out, so focus on the vision game
                        and wait for him or his team to go on one of your
                        allies, so you can Cold Embrace or Winter's Curse to
                        start the counter-engagement. Once CK gets any amount
                        of Strength you'll find Splinter Blast woefully
                        inadequate to clear out his Phantasm illusions, so
                        perhaps consider a more utility or split pushing type
                        item build.

                        Chen's mob of creeps is actually pretty easily
                        controlled with Splinter Blast early on, especially the
                        slow when he's trying to run down one of your allies.
                        In general Wyvern's sustained magic DPS from Splinter
                        Blast excels against pushing lineups like those that
                        Chen usually pairs up with, so Wyvern as a support or a
                        core always functions well against him. Roaming Chen
                        ganks can be problematic for a mid Wyvern, but with
                        appropriate wards and TP support you'll be fine.
                        Consider taking Cold Embrace at level 2 for defensive
                        reasons if Chen is still off the map and you fear he
                        might be smoke ganking you.

                        will clear a Prophet push right out. Nature's might
                        have the advantage at levels 1-2, even if you go for
                          a Null Talisman build, but once you get level 2
                        Splinter Blast things will change. Like most close
                        lane matchups, if you add an aura like Drow to the
                        laning stage or roaming support you'll do just
                        as well as most other mid/offlane heroes.

                        to her abnormally high damage nuke spam plus the
                        percent-based damage of Arctic Burn. Picking up an Orb

                        with farm your superior range will make Dragon Knight
                        look quite weak. His counter-play potential ranges from
                        Blink or Shadow Blade to get on top of you, to Mek/Pipe
                        and possibly BKB to thwart most of your damage. Once
                        Dragon Knight hits his stride, you need to rely on your
                        team, and possible the DK's (Winter's Curse) to pick off
                        the DK when he's out of position. You'll need a Blink
                        of your own likely.

                        Bristleback falls into the same category as DK—too tanky
                        for most heroes to harass out of lane. Wyvern
                        specializes in punishing these heroes, infact you can
                        sometimes justify higher levels in Arctic Burn before
                        level 6 just so you can continue spamming it in these
                        situations. Once Bristle gets a few items he'll
                        definitely reach the point where he's too tanky for
                        you to take down alone, but by that point as a Corevern
                        you should also be strong enough to kill his teammates,
                        forcing some teamfights most likely.

                        Timbersaw is difficult for most heroes to deal with,
                        but especially in mid where there's fewer trees for him
                        to chain to Wyvern can consider the matchup manageable.
                        Without plentiful trees to run you down, Timbersaw isn't
                        really fast enough to run you down with Whirling Death
                        or Chakram once he hits 6, so as the Wyvern player you
                        should be mostly free to CS, but beware of feeding him
                        virtually free Reactive Armor stacks with your puny
                        right-click harass early on. Phase Boots may be in order

                        Tiny is the classic example of kitable melee hero—too

                        enough to give a wide berth. Your Splinter Blast harass
                        starting at level 3 or 4 should be enough to make his
                        day miserable, and hopefully push him back to base, but
                        in some cases Tiny may have a support in lane, like IO
                        or someone with a stun he can throw, like Tusk. These
                        combos make the lane much harder for the Wyvern, but
                        sometimes seeking support help of your own can put you
                        further behind as you'll gain less experience. In some
                        cases, beating the enemy duo-lane to level 3 and using

                        wants to run you down and Cog you in the early game.
                        Whether a core or a support, if Clockwerk is in your

                        won't get the jump on you or isn't faster than you.
                        He's easy enough to zone out otherwise, but don't

                        Doom running you down before you have at least Boots of
                        your own. If that means missing experience sometimes in
                        order to be safe, so be it. Doom can harass you with
                        his Infernal Blade, dealing plenty of damage, but you
                        have more than enough of your own to trade blows. Doom's
                        low armor also makes him a perfect Winter's Curse
                        target, and denying his ultimate in a fight can be
                        an instant win on its own.

                        BUT the matchup does come out rather evenly if the two
                        are left alone. While Alchemist has a farm accelerator
                        to help him pull away, and can do stacks, Wyvern is
                        excellent at withstanding Alchemist's Acid Spray spam
                        by sustaining with Cold Embrace, and deals tons of
                        damage to Alchemist at levels 4-5, enough to potentially
                        force him out of lane. Always save Arctic Burn for the
                        rune spawns when going mid against the Alch, that way
                        you have it to deny his bounty, get some free harass,

                        anyway that Magnus could safely skewer you back towards
                        his own tower without eating some tower shots at least.
                        If you can Cold Embrace on the highground, at mid, or
                        behind some trees, in the sidelanes, Magnus will think
                        twice about going on you. Splinter Blast matches Magnus
                        for damage per second but not in mana efficiency, so
                        focus on abusing the fact that Magnus has a Bottle most
                        likely and you have a Soul Ring to push in the lanes
                        on the 2-minute-interval marks, forcing him to miss
                        as much experience as you can as his tower kills your

                        you'll be free to get the other rune just as he comes

                        targets thanks to Double Edge. In general, laning

                        is so slow that you can Curse or Orchid him during it,
                        hopefully leading you to a won fight. Last, but not

                        hopefully you can use Arctic Burn somewhere in there

                        is true of pretty much every hero, Wyvern is a unique
                        case, most similar to Sniper, in that she really does
                        have a unique skillset that deserves to be utilized
                        aggressively at times. Between her insanely long
                        range and low attack point, plus the other effects
                        of Arctic Burn, Wyvern is a truly unique ranged
                        carry that reaches her final form when paired with these
                        auras.

                        Drow lineups are considered very risky these days, but
                        this is a totally unexplored and I think very strong
                        combo. Safelane Drow with early aura points to secure
                        last-hits for Wyvern and another ranged core can lead
                        to some very snowbally early pushing. Drow is
                        inherently squishy and vulnerable, both of which Wyvern
                        can supplement via Embrace and Curse respectively.
                        Heroes with similar damage boosting auras, like Luna
                        and Vengeful, can also fill the role, though not during
                        the crucial laning stage, making Drow the ULTIMATE in
                        support for a Corevern. If I was trying to cheese
                        someone with Wyvern, this would be my go-to combo.

                        This is the very essence of cheese: a rarely used,
                        recently added Aghanim's upgrade that might be stupidly
                        broken when combined with some other aspects of the
                        hero pairing. Wyvern and Magnus have TONS of obvious
                        synergy besides his new Aghs upgrade, which turns
                        Empower into an aura. Winter's Curse is an excellent
                        setup for Reverse Polarity, and vice versa, but the
                        combo of two high DPS AoE nukes and 1000-range cleaving
                        slowing ranged attacks is equally as compelling.
                        I think Magnus could be a component of a the ultimate
                        Wyvern/Drow cheese draft, but fitting both
                        a core Wyvern and a core Magnus in one lineup likely
                        means one of them has to offlane. An Alchemist could
                        be nice to help Magnus reach a timely Aghs too.

                        Yeah, sure—Wyvern is also a pretty good counter to
                        Troll. But as far as core Wyvern is concerned, Troll
                        ult is one of the best damage steroids she can get.
                        Free attack speed plus a tank to play off of Cold
                        Embrace and Curse. I'd almost say that push strats
                        involving Wyvern and Troll would be highly successful,
                        one issue you'd have would be who gets the support

                        Venge's aura is simply second to none when it comes
                        to power that scales all game long. Since it's
                        percent-based rather than a flat value, Venge's aura
                        scales just as well as the rest of her kit, which is
                        basically straight utility. Venge is simply the best
                        support you can put with Corevern.

                        Luna's aura may not be global like Drow's is, but
                        when early teamfights happen especially Luna's
                        static +damage aura is usually stronger than
                        Venge's or Drow's. If you're looking to craft
                        a lineup that pushes hard early, something
                        like Luna Wyvern Beastmaster Chen +1 would
                        work swimmingly. Luna as a safelaner combos
                        well with Wyvern so long as you don't stack
                        Eclipse over Curse. Some kind of frontliner or tank
                        generally helps when you have this many glass

                        Beastmaster is an excellent offlaner to combo with
                        Wyvern as a core, or potentially with support Wyvern
                        too simply because the vision and attack speed
                        Beastmaster provides are always useful. Not only
                        does his Hawk provide a way for you to chase opponents
                        over rough terrain, but the Boar slow stacks perfectly
                        with Arctic Burn and Splinter Blast to make teamfights
                        very difficult for enemy melee heroes to navigate.
                        Beastmaster also excels at pushing relatively early,
                        especially with Necronomicon, which is another Aura
                        perfect for your strategy in all of these cases.

                        beyond her vision at night and when trees are involved.
                        Arctic Burn may provide flying movement, but without

                        Bounty Hunter is the simplest combo, and sometimes the
                        most effective since he's so great at comebacks. Track
                        provides simple vision over just the target—enough to
                        keep attacking at max range while you chase someone
                        down as they flee. The other two heroes in this section
                        offer a more direct damage increase, however, so
                        consider Bounty Hunter as more of a "standard" rather
                        than <i>cheesy</i> combo. BH + Wyvern was actually a
                        popular support duo especially in China leading up
                        to TI5, and so if you pick one the other is always
                        a good pairing no matter the role. Just focus on
                        picking to counter physical damage as usual.

                        Bloodseeker is by far the cheesiest vision combo you
                        can put with Wyvern, as once your enemies get under
                        a certain threshold they're doomed unless they can
                        outrun you. Now Wyvern, being a pretty slow hero, can
                        actually suffer in situations against particularly
                        fast opponents, but Bloodseeker himself also counters
                        that with Rupture and his passive. The damage boost
                        from Bloodrage is a particularly safe option on
                        long-range damage dealers like Wyvern, so long as you
                        don't get jumped on. Factor in the aforementioned
                        Thirst UAV radar and this is a very uniquely strong
                        duo, very comparable to Bloodseeker + Sniper but with
                        more utility of course.

                        Since there's a slight projectile speed on the Ravage
                        stun itself, Ravage is actually particularly easy
                        to hit after a Winter's Curse because it doesn't have
                        to be so exact. Wyvern, as either a support or a core,
                        can use Curse any time she can catch out 2 or more
                        heroes, and if Tidehunter is in range that's a perfect
                        chain stun. Offlane Tidehunter has great timings to
                        work with you as a mid Wyvern, getting support items
                        like Mek or Pipe to aid in the push effort so Wyvern
                        can focus on damage. If you really need to use Ravage
                        first in a fight, make sure as the Wyvern player to
                        tell your team if you intend to follow up with a
                        Curse next, so they don't waste any spells.

                        Void is a very simple combo to use with Wyvern, so
                        long as you use it in the right order. Chronosphere
                        does prevent enemies from attacking, nullifying any
                        Curse within its duration, BUT if you Winter's Curse
                        first and use the Chrono as a follow-up, that's the
                        perfect teamfight. Offlane or Safelane Void work
                        quite well with Wyvern no matter the role, but be
                        careful not to Cold Embrace him in situations where
                        he would prefer to Timewalk out. Wyvern's long-range
                        makes it very convenient for her to dump damage into
                        Chronospheres—another good reason for early BoTs on
                        Wyvern.

                        While the main combo of Sanity's Eclipse after Curse
                        to clean up is easily executed enough (SE is instant),
                        the <i>even better</i> part of this combo is that OD
                        can take advantage of the invulnerable enemies to
                        stack up Intelligence steal from his Arcane Orbs,
                        just like Slark also can. OD and Wyvern work well
                        in a Drow lineup together, just be careful of the
                        obvious counter-picks (Nyx, for one). You can also
                        try to abuse OD's aura with Splinter Blast spam, but
                        that one can be almost too random to rely on.

                        Phoenix is perhaps the single best wombo combo a Wyvern
                        can hope for—the Phoenix Supernova into Winter's Curse:
                        Moltres and Articuno. Wyvern mid with Phoenix offlane
                        is a fairly risky combo due to their low armor, but
                        could definitely give your team a strong early/mid
                        game. These days Phoenix is more often a support, which
                        works decently well with the slows of Wyvern to run
                        down enemies and burn them with Sun Ray.

                        Black Hole is a great combo with Winter's Curse since
                        you can very simply just overlap the duration a tiny
                        bit to make sure no one escapes, giving your team
                        up to 8.75 seconds of BKB-piercing disable in total.
                        Enigma is still a strong jungler, making him perhaps
                        the best afk jungler to pair with Wyvern if you're
                        going to go that route. Enigma coming out of the
                        jungle with an Early mek can be game-changing,
                        especially in some kind of Drow push strat, for
                        instance.

                        With his long duration spells and easily overlappable
                        Ice Path, Jakiro does an excellent job comboing with
                        Wyvern, plus his slow animations won't impact you
                        as much with a Wyvern to set up for him. Blink on
                        Wyvern, for example, lets your slow Jakiro follow
                        up with his Ice Path at the appropriate time after
                        Wyvern jumps in for a Curse. Jakiro's early game
                        is a little weaker than some supports unless you're
                        getting a chance to wail on towers with Liquid Fire,
                        so make sure to go for some kind of aggressive
                        gameplan here.

                        Naga in general doesn't seem to be as powerful as
                        she once was, but since the combo of Song into
                        Curse remains exceptionally strong we might as well
                        discuss it here. Naga has seen some place as a support
                        and core both, like Wyvern hopefully will one day,
                        meaning that at worst these two heroes are useful to
                        pick together because they don't give anything away.
                        Unless your Naga is particularly fed these two
                        alone won't have enough damage to win most fights,
                        so grab some more wombo combo to go along with what
                        may be the two strongest setups in the game.

                        In case you haven't figured out the pattern by now:
                        like all the other heroes on this list, Disruptor can
                        drop his area-denial spells, in the form of his
                        Static Storm and Kinetic Field, while your opponents
                        are Winter's Cursed and losing a small amount of the
                        CC or damage is inconsequential. Static Storm in
                        particular is the perfect way to ensure that a slippery
                        opponent like Weaver, Anti-Mage, Morphling or Ember
                        Spirit can't get away from your ganks. Disruptor is
                        perhaps the best in the game at this, so grab him early
                        on when you see such a slippery enemy in the draft.

                        Puck has both a silence and a leash, allowing him to
                        perform actually the exact same function as Disruptor
                        after the Winter's Curse ends, BUT Puck is a completely
                        different hero who of course should probably go mid or
                        offlane, whichever one is more dangerous (if you're
                        trying to run Wyvern as the other one). Puck isn't quite
                        as reliant as his Blink timing as some heroes, so
                        luckily if you pick a Drow-type lineup with Wyvern
                        and Puck you won't be entirely screwed if things go
                        poorly in the early game. Focus on making space and
                        splitting the map, and your team can definitely compete
                        on physical damage in the late-game.

                        This one might seem obvious, BUT it's surprisingly

                        a second or two of it just because of Winter's Curse is
                        not big deal. It gives Venomancer a moment to set up
                        wards around the battle, plus Venomancer and Warlock
                        make a disgusting combo and as supports would be
                        disgusting with Drow safelane/<whoever mid>/offlane
                        Wyern type lineups. Venomancer is just an all around
                        versatile damage dealer, and his ability to grab
                        support items plus even Veil helps Wyvern do her thing.

                        Shadow Fiend is an excellent combo with Wyvern both
                        because of all that magic damage he can dump in to a
                        chaotic teamfight right after Curse ends, but also
                        because of the minus armor Aura from Presence of the
                        Dark Lord. The timing of Winter's Curse into Requiem
                        of Souls can be tricky to pull off, but with a Shadow
                        Blade or BKB you'll find that the Shadow Fiend merely
                        has to keep canceling until he knows he won't be early,
                        so long as your opponents aren't going to BKB/blink
                        out right away or otherwise escape in an instant.

                        with Wyvern, but magic amplification <i>IS</i> what
                        they all have in common. Wyvern's sustained magic
                        DPS from Splinter Blast and Arctic Burn's burn
                        can be enough reason to go for these heroes on their
                        own, but you might want to add in some AoE stuns and
                        damage if you want to construct a lineup around magic
                        amplification. Without stuns to help line it up,
                        these heroes tend to fall flat on their own.

                        capabilities like AA does. Ice Vortex can amplify
                        Splinter Blast during the laning stage, Chilling Touch
                        with Arctic Burn provides intense ranged harass, and
                        later on Ice Blast onto Winter's Curse is an easily won
                        teamfight. Picking the combo early probably isn't
                        advised, but if you do the enemy may assume that you've
                        just picked your two supports, hopefully leading them
                        to waste some bans and letting you get the support of
                        your choice.

                        Elder Titan buffs everyone's damage evenly, so to
                        speak, but few heroes put out as much magic AND
                        physical damage as a Corevern does. She benefits from
                        both aspects of the Elder Titan Natural Order aura,
                        plus the additional setup from Echo Stomp makes
                        any team with Wyvern + ET's teamfight off the charts.
                        Be sure to pair them up with even more wombo combo,
                        as the Wyvern and Titan on their own can't really
                        sustain a teamfight for 3 squishy carries.

                        Undying's ultimate provides an up to 25% damage increase
                        while he's in Flesh Golem form, but the rest of
                        Undying's kit actually suits an aggressive early push
                        style lineup quite well. For this reason Undying and
                        Wyvern as a support duo was even somewhat common back
                        around the Frankfurt Major and OG's golden days. The
                        Tombstone provides an excellent distraction for enemies
                        while Wyvern can plink away at them from long range,
                        slowing them further and creating the perfect chaotic
                        teamfight for a Wyvern to control. Finally, Undying is
                        the perfect hero to build Mek and Pipe in such a lineup.

                        Warlock's <i>recently buffed</i> Fatal Bonds is actually
                        in many cases more powerful for a Wyvern than Warlock's
                        signature ultimate, Reign of Chaos, now that lower
                        levels in Fatal Bonds are more useful. While early
                        points into Upheaval-based builds have been in vogue
                        some as well, Fatal Bonds plus Splinter Blast and

                        push 10-20 minutes in, can be absolutely devastating.
                        Reign of Chaos on top of that might not even be needed
                        in some cases, provided you have other AoE stuns to pair

                        Ogre's main purpose in most lineups, besides running
                        at people and hitting them that is, is buffing up a

                        aura. Just ridiculous. Pair Ogre and Wyvern with some
                        strong physical damage dealers that can easily get on
                        top of enemies and you have a gameplan. Ogre also makes
                        an excellent partner with Wyvern in lane at level 1,
                        bullying out the enemy with dual slows with Ignite plus
                        Arctic Burn.

                        each, max +115 with Invoker aghs). Sun Strike and

                        simply having a Blink on Legion to initiate and

                        Oracle is just a clutch support in general, but the
                        overwhelming amount of synergy he has with many
                        different heroes seems to mean he's always a safe early
                        pick. The defensive combo of Fate's Edict plus Cold
                        Embrace makes one of your allies invulnerable to
                        everything except magic-piercing spell damage, and
                        Fortune's End allows Oracle to kite enemies for Wyvern
                        and help her keep her distance. Oracle has quite the
                        right-click for an otherwise physically weak support,
                        so he's the perfect combo when you want to go for a
                        Drow strategy, plus his ultimate amplifies heals
                        meaning you can also use Cold Embrace on someone

                        reserved for a lane you're far behind in. Viper's
                        potent slows can ruin your escape plan, which is
                        usually just, "FLY OVER THOSE TREES" or "FLY OVER THAT
                        CLIFF". Lastly, Viper is an annoying target to Curse,
                        since his orb won't affet his allies if he's a
                        secondary target, and he's generally too tanky to burst

                        dangerous—plus in lane it means you'll have to play
                        extra carefully. If QoP goes heavily into the Shadow
                        Strike harass, leveling Cold Embrace early on may be
                        necessary simply to stay healed up and safe. Keep in

                        she hits 6 you're vulnerable to being burst down. If

                        game progresses, an early Orchid is an excellent item
                        to hunt QoP down and potentially force her to commit
                        for a defensive item (which you can then 1-up with
                        Winter's Curse after she uses her BKB/Eul's/Linkens).

                        OD is, for the most part, the strongest mid you'll
                        encounter these days, largely because he has a strong
                        defensive measure in the form of Astral to ensure
                        your Splinter Blast harass misses, and that if you ever
                        try to run, go on him, or even heal while he's nearby
                        he'll Imprison you. OD's pure damage orb-walking from
                        Arcane Orb can be especially annoying too, as it also
                        goes right through Cold Embrace. OD's ultimate, goes
                        right through Cold Embrace. Just avoid playing against
                        OD when possible. If you have to face him mid, try to
                        coordinate with supports to kill him before he gets
                        to level 3 or so. OD with an early CS lead can slow
                        your own farm with his intelligence steal, and you
                        absolutely need mana to keep nabbing what CS you can.

                        Silencer is a terrifying opponent both in lane and in
                        late-game teamfights—a fact that pretty much every hero
                        must face. Wyvern is not especially vulnerable—since
                        she can counterplay Last Word by using Cold Embrace on
                        herself—but the Glaives harass is especially hard to
                        deal with without a proper escape. Your best hope is
                        that he doesn't burn too much of your mana with Curse,
                        allowing you to punish him when he gets near creeps.
                        Late-game, attempt to counterplay the Silencer by
                        initiating on him, rather than the other way around.

                        TA is a devastating opponent despite Wyvern's somewhat
                        useful ability to burn down her Refraction quickly with
                        Arctic Burn, thanks to the superior base damage and
                        of course bonus damage TA's kit offers. She may not be
                        as durable against you as a Wyvern, but she'll still
                        out-CS you by a mile unless you kill her a couple times
                        early. Losing a lane to TA may not be the end of the
                        game if your team can take advantage of your early
                        farm to push before TA gets too far ahead, but either
                        way playing Wyvern 1v1 or even potentially against the
                        TA in general can be dangerous. Wyvern certainly doesn't
                        have a ton of armor, so while she can save allies from
                        TA burst thanks to Cold Embrace, some of the pure damage
                        will still go through, and TA will most likely outlast
                        the Cold Embrace, unless you get off a clutch Winter's
                        Curse. Kiting her with Skadi and Aghanim's in the
                        late-game can can still give Corevern a fighting chance
                        at scaling.

                        Puck is one of the most frustrating opponents to go
                        against because he will easily dodge your Splinter Blast
                        harassment with Phase Shift. Despite Puck's other
                        aggressive tendencies, his somewhat low health and
                        500 range means he's more of a fair fight than, say,
                        Lina, who's not even listed in this section. Puck still
                        has to rely on his Illusory Orb to last hit sometimes,
                        and can't dodge an entire Arctic Burn without a misplay
                        by the Wyvern player. Winter's Curse is also really
                        excellent at locking down and killing the Puck during
                        teamfights, so overall the matchup tends to even out
                        after the Puck's power spike right after getting Blink.
                        As a Corevern going against Puck, just make sure that if
                        the Puck gets support in lane, you do as well.

                        Tinker is a dangerous hero because of his potential
                        high magic burst before he finishes his Boots of Travel,
                        but sometimes Tinker doesn't even go for that build.
                        If the Tinker player goes for Laser + Missiles to finish
                        you off during Cold Embrace, and you let yourself be in
                        vision while you're low enough to die, you deserve it.
                        Otherwise you can hope that Tinker goes for a
                        March-based build and that he doesn't have the mana
                        regen to sustain repeated Laser spam—the main way Tinker
                        disrupts your CS. After you make it through the mid-game
                        and find a Blink or potentially Aghanim's of your own,
                        Corevern is excellent and hunting down and killing

                        Be careful when casting Cold Embrace near one of these

                        your teammate anyway! Since one of Wyvern's core skills
                        Cold Embrace blocks only physical damage, you really
                        need to pay attention to the number of magic burst and
                        physical heroes in the draft. If you go for a Corevern
                        but the enemy seems to counter you, it may be wise to
                        rotate Wyvern to a support role. It's usually better to
                        have a marginalized support than a core!

                        Despite a rollercoaster of nerfs and recently buffs,
                        Lina has always been a dangerous opponent to Wyvern,
                        owed mainly to her high-damage spell combo and longgg
                        attack range, which give her a significant laning
                        advantage even in matchups of equal skill. Laguna Blade
                        goes straight through Cold Embrace—even without Lina's
                        Aghanim's upgrade—thus you really need to watch who you
                        heal during counter-ganks. A clever Wyvern can
                        outmanuever the Lina during the mid-game by using
                        Arctic Burn and to initiate from unexpected angles,
                        but, in general, just having a Lina on the enemy team
                        will always make your life harder as a Wyvern. In a 1v1
                        mid matchup, Lina's frustratingly long attack range
                        will make your first few CS very painful, but once you
                        get Soul Ring Lina will have to respect you more. The
                        key is really making it that long—you might need to
                        ask for support.

                        means that he's perfectly capable of CSing against you,

                        long range, but a Leshrac who's allowed to clean up

                        even then Wyvern has so much counter-play potential.
                        Wyvern can punish an over-farmed Morphling by making
                        him delete one of his teammates, and save whoever
                        Morphling goes on, both relying on whether Morphling
                        does any physical damage. Just using the Winter's Curse

                        smartly targeting their ults onto the Cold Embraced
                        target, you might just find yourself wishing you weren't
                        a Wyvern. Don't fret, though! If the crux of your
                        teamfight truly is the Wyvern's ability to save people
                        with Cold Embrace, then you as the Wyvern player can
                        always go one step further, even as a core, to buy
                        either Glimmer Cape or Force Staff to help save them.
                        Even a Lotus or Linken's could theoretically add to your
                        Embrace. Lion is a particularly good example because
                        all four options would work pretty well against him.

                        Standing still against a good Storm can be as good as
                        a death sentence, and for that reason Cold Embrace will
                        often turn dangerous when you use it while Storm's
                        around. As soon as Storm knows you're going to be

                        into the self-disable of Cold Embrace. Pre level 6
                        you'll find the lane is way more manageable, since Storm
                        has a rather short attack range and nuke range, so use
                        this time to get ahead on CS and harass him through his

                        even deal heavy magic damage through Embrace, means that
                        throughout the game Mirana has a chance to scale well

              • Picking Wyvern early can sometimes be useful to draw out
                specific bans, like Dark Seer, due to her strong synergy with
                certain heroes, BUT she <i>also</i> has an innate weakness to
                burst magic damage which can be exploited by a smart opponent.

              • As a mid laner, she's suited to pushing lineups that take
                advantage of her sustain and wave clearing to take towers early
                and eventually high ground around the 35:00 minute mark. Going
                past this point, into the late game with Wyvern isn't terrible,
                but without damage items there's always the risk that Wyvern
                just misses an ult and gets run over by a team with shorter
                cooldowns!

              All these builds are a variant of 4-4-2-2. In general, max
              Splinter Blast first and Arctic Burn second, always a point in
              Cold Embrace by level 4, and sometimes you might take a second
              point in Cold Embrace early because it's such a value point (more
              than doubles the sustain). Skipping your ultimate is always
              acceptable if you aren't leaving lane to gank or counter-gank
              (which might not be a good thing—playing with your team is key to
              making Corevern work)!

              This build just attempts to skate by with one point in Cold
              Embrace until level 12, which is actually pretty risky these days
              with the amount of magic burst some heroes have. At level 7
              1-4-1-1 is the standard, but in the following builds I discuss
              going 2-4-1-0 or 1-4-2-0 as well:

                  There are some cases when Splinter Blast may be preferable at
                  level 1, to get guaranteed CS in lane if you're saving for a
                  Bottle or straight rushing Soul Ring without a Null Talisman,
                  and RARELY you might need Cold Embrace to save your own life
                  or an ally's, but generally if you're trying to establish
                  lane dominance 1v1 Arctic Burn is your scariest skill. The
                  instant you see your lane opponent, say hello by taking 34%
                  of their health—plus as many souped-up right-clicks as you
                  can—and get that Burn on cooldown.

                  Maxed Splinter Blast is <i>the</i> greedy build for core

                  first for kill potential in lane, but as a core it's vital to
                  ramping up your farm. Only spam level 1 Blast 1-2 times in
                  lane—you'll need to stretch a single manapool out until you

                  Level 2 Splinter Blast deals 180 damage—it definitely hurts

                  your Splinter Blasts primarily to maximize CS, but
                  secondarily attempt to hit your opponent as many times as
                  possible. Make sure and place the initial projectile—the one
                  that deals no damage—on a full health creep if possible, so
                  that you push out the lane as little as possible.

                  In some games you may have to level Cold Embrace earlier to

                  ideal time, since you'll usually be getting it right before
                  your Soul Ring arrives. The combo of Soul Ring→Splinter

                  CS and set you up for 1-2 more easily, plus your opponent
                  hopefully loses health. Save Arctic Burn for escapes if your

                  Level 1 Winter's Curse is short enough in duration—only 3.25

                  it to catch enemies in a clump, out of position, or to keep

                  Level 10 presents a conundrum for most heroes now because at level 10
                  you get your first choice of talents. For Wyvern specifically, neither
                  of her level 10 Talents is particularly strong enough to warrant picking
                  up before maxing out Arctic Burn.

                      Plus Strength talents like these on non-Strength heroes are
                      primarily for when you're behind and need to avoid feeding.
                      If this is happening to you as a Corever, something has gone

                      spell amplification and +96 mana so it's certainly the
                      more aggressive choice. Putting it off until level 14 may
                      not be the <i>worst</i> idea in some games, but I think
                      the upside of getting Cold Embrace points a little sooner
                      is fairly low.

                  Level 2 Winter's Curse provides you with 4 seconds of
                  disable, and at this point your enemies should probably know
                  not to get caught out by you. Consider a pickup like Blink
                  Dagger to catch your enemies off guard even further. Curse may

                  Leveling up Cold Embrace increases your chances of surviving

                  okay—it happens to the best of us sometimes. Just remember
                  that the first point is the biggest value, since it DOUBLES
                  in effect. Further points double again, but at a 50% and 33%
                  incremental increase respectively, so there's no good
                  argument for taking more than one additional point in Embrace

                  Winter's Curse is now ways near as big of a deal as it

                      120 Gold per Minute is exactly as good as it sounds on a hero
                      like Wyvern: despite the fact that you farm pretty well with this

                      find damage items like nothing any time you're doing remotely well.

                      +15% Arctic Burn slow is strong, but even moreso in the right
                      situation and when combined with Eye of Skadi. Without a good
                      reason to need <i>more</i> slow, I tend to go for the increased
                      damage output and pushing from Splinter Blast cooldown instead.

                      Level 25 is definitely the hardest choice, because both options
                      are so good, but in general the damage potential of more Splinter
                      Blast outweighs the Arctic Burn slow unless you're dealing with
                      kitable melee enemies like Ursa, Wraith King, etc. The -3s
                      Splinter Blast cooldown has applications against creeps as well
                      as against heroes, meaning you'll be able to draw out the game
                      longer if that's something you're interested in. Just be aware
                      that if you don't have the mana regen to support the reduced
                      cooldown, you might as well go for the Arctic Burn slow talent.

              When it comes to skill builds for Core Wyvern, they've become
              more flexible over time as I realized that Winter's Curse is
              no longer the centerpiece of Wyvern's kit. Despite it being your
              ultimate, and a BKB-piercing stun, sometimes you might want to
              skip Winter's Curse until as late as level 11! This would be
              mainly in 1v1 lanes where farming, zoning your enemy and sustain
              are your priority, in that order—not because you're bad at using
              Curse! If you end up rotating to gank or counter-gank, you usually
              take a point in Winter's Curse:

                  Taking an additional point in Arctic Burn at level 6 is the most
                  aggressive possible option, but it only really gets you an advantage
                  over Winter's Curse when you're planning to use the spell off cooldown
                  (and have the mana regen to support it along with Splinter Blast) or
                  when you just won't be using Winter's Curse anyway. Winter's Curse
                  may not be useful to you if your opponents are too tanky, won't clump
                  up or don't have enough damage to kill with. But sometimes Winter's
                  Curse has a purpose as a set-up—while as a Corevern you generally want
                  to use Curse to get kills when you can, the complicated nature of
                  this level 6 decision means that it mostly determines your pacing for
                  the rest of the mid-game.

            <h4>More Sustain = Stay in Lane</h4>
            <p>
              Besides the more aggressive adjustments you can make, taking
              an additional point in Cold Embrace early can make a huge
              difference in whether you get to stay in lane and hit that
              crucial level 9 faster, or whether you're forced back to base
              for mana and health. Level 2 Cold embrace offers the biggest
              single point improvement in amount of healing: from level 1 to
              level 2 is a 33% improvement, while level 3 and 4 are 25% and 20%
              increase respectively. Interestingly, IceFrog has balanced the
              skill so that the
              <a data-toggle="tooltip"
                title="For a 1200 hp hero, Cold Embrace heals roughly

                style="white-space: nowrap;">healing per second increase</a>
              from level 1 through
              level 4 Cold Embrace is constant (roughly 38% per level):

                  Taking another point in Cold Embrace early seems defensive at first,
                  but being able to stay healed up that much higher also means you can
                  afford to play more aggressively and soak up that much more harass.
                  Especially as a safelane or crossover support Wyvern this type of
                  build might make sense. Same as with leveling Arctic Burn at level 6,
                  however, you need to be sure that you won't need Winter's Curse before
                  going for this greedy option. If you anticipate that the laning stage
                  will last longer than usual because neither team can effectively find
                  ganks, for example.

                    The combination of three things Wyvern desperately needs
                    to win a 1v1 matchup—armor, mana regen, and damage—makes
                    Ring of Basilius a surprisingly good starting item on Wyvern.
                    While I used to recommend Null Talisman here instead, now
                    that 7.00 has given us Shrines you may not even want to build
                    a Soul Ring at all (plus Bottle is way more useful). Having
                    the +.65 static mana regen from minute 0 has a nearly
                    guaranteed payoff over the length of most games.

                    With the buffs to Mango in 7.00 you could actually buy
                    one more Mango here to start! But I don't necessarily
                    think you need it if you're able to get a Bounty Rune,
                    which nearly guarantees you'll finish Soul Ring before
                    your level 3 arrives and you get Level 2 Splinter Blast.
                    Rushing Soul Ring is mainly reserved for dangerous solo offlanes
                    or dual offlanes, where in both cases you'll be threatened
                    from minute 0 and won't last hit much before you have the
                    mana regen to spam Splinter.

                      This strategy relies on your lane pressure to hobble
                      your opponent's farm in lane—without enough mana regen
                      this simply isn't possible, and Sage's Masks are the single
                      best item in this regard because they're both cost effective
                      and !!!re-usable!!!, which is very important. Items like
                      Null Talisman and Phase Boots are great early game items,
                      but since they don't build into anything you'll use in
                      your 6-slot you really can't afford those items during
                      your crucial early game unless absolutely necessary. Hold
                      on to your Sage's Masks until it's time for an Orchid, or
                      if you're a support you can always use them for
                      Urn/Medallion and even Eul's or Drum.

                      Prior to 7.00 I would usually make do with just the Sage's
                      Masks as early-game regen, but especially now that there's
                      so much pressure to keep the pace up in the early game, never
                      going back to base if possible, Void Stone makes about as much
                      sense as any other item unless you'd rather start your Maelstrom
                      early. While an earlier Maelstrom <i>can</i> be more beneficial
                      than the mana regen from Void Stone, Void Stone is a reliable
                      choice for you as Wyvern because it allows you to get more
                      free farm with Splinter Blast spam. If you don't have a safe lane
                      to farm in, skip this Void Stone entirely.

                      Wyvern is a <i>slow</i> hero—not to mention she needs to
                      be at every fight she can if you're bothering to make her
                      a core. For these reasons alone Boots of Travel are game
                      changers on Winter Wyvern, but especially in light of her
                      abilities as a flash-farmer and split-pusher. The 70-second
                      cooldown on Teleport Scroll just won't cut it if you're
                      going to put heavy pressure on the enemy as a Corevern.

                      With Soul Ring plus Cold Embrace, Wyvern can farm and

                      is at her peak, with best-in-class spam—enough to force

                      Raindrops are the most slot efficient mana regen you can get
                      your hands on this early, before your intelligence rises
                      and percent-based regen increases in value, so always pick
                      one up early if you have a spare item slot. Even without the
                      magic block effect, Raindrop is an exceptional item for casters

                      source of mana regen (and health) that neither Corevern or a
                      support Wyvern can ignore. Use your judgement here, but Wand is
                      only worth the diversion when you know you'll save your life with
                      it.

                      Aquila on your mid Invoker then you'll definitely like it on your

                      For a while after 7.00 I considered Drum good enough to be
                      a core/every-game item on Corevern, but after testing it
                      repeatedly I just found that having to sell your ~1,800
                      gold movement speed item in the mid-to-late game was too
                      much of a deterrent to say that Drum is <i>always</i> a good
                      idea. If you have an extra Sage's Mask and a Wind Lace just
                      laying around, or if you're having a slow game but are required
                      to do a lot of fighting, then I'd say that Drum is likely
                      to pay for itself.

                      Dragon Lance is a convenient item for Wyvern because it synergizes
                      with your attack range from Arctic Burn and makes you as little
                      safer while farming/pushing/fighting, but in reality the lack of
                      actual damage from this ~1,800 gold item means that you can't
                      really justify it as an every game item unless you plan to somehow
                      get a lot of value from its upgrade, Hurricane Pike. While some heroes
                      like OD make excellent use of an early Pike, Wyvern just isn't
                      like that, so this item makes less sense for her as an early
                      damage item.

                      I personally never get Hand of Midas on Wyvern because I think
                      Maelstrom does the same job much better. Besides accelerating your
                      farm Maelstrom gives straight damage too. If you really think that
                      you'll fall behind in levels without it, I think a Midas makes more
                      sense on a roaming support Wyvern who's trying to transition to a
                      core role rather than on a Core Wyvern herself, who can just build
                      damage and then go farm enemy heroes to accelerate her farm. The
                      introduction of Wyvern's level 20 GPM talent further reinforces
                      this.

                    Blink can be an extremely key item for getting off those
                    clutch Curses and Cold Embraces—but in games where you
                    aren't having trouble getting off your spells or getting
                    caught out, it can be preferable to continue straight
                    into more damage or utility items instead. Blink is never
                    a bad idea, however, especially if you can save your own
                    life with it even once by blinking out of a bad
                    situation. Be sure to make the most of your blink reveal
                    by catching your enemies out with a big surprise
                    initiation.

                    Orchid is the best intelligence and damage-dealing item
                    Wyvern can get, plus the silence effectively doubles her
                    lockdown. Threaten a gank with Orchid, then Winter's
                    Curse everyone when their friends show up to

                    BKB/Eul's/Manta, then lock them down with Curse!  The
                    applications are endless. Especially good against any
                    hero with an escape.

                    This item fills a unique niche for Wyvern since her
                    playstyle after getting Aghanim's relies so heavily on
                    escaping across trees. No other item gives you the security
                    that Linken's does against targeted spells from your
                    opponents—PLUS it has the perfect stats for you and a
                    decent buildup. I've tested many other items as the
                    secondary mana item to accompany Orchid/Bloodthorn (such as
                    Bloodstone, Scythe) but of them all Linken's fits the slot
                    best. You can pick up a Void Stone early on and complete
                    Linken's either right before or right after Aghanim's, and
                    complete Orchid vice versa. If the fights go well enough
                    lategame, you may be able to hang back and use your
                    Linken's supportively on your team's frontliners.

                      than perhaps any other hero, it doesn't do much for her
                      damage output—the side of the hero we're interested in

                      Just like with Linken's Sphere Wyvern makes an excellent
                      Lotus carrier because she intends to stay out of the
                      fight, and will thus be positioned to cast it on allies.
                      The ability to dispel debuffs is highly underrated and
                      can be seriously fight-winning on its own. The fact that
                      it can't reactively save your life, unlike Linken's, however,
                      means that it's much less effective on a Core Wyvern.

                      Refresher used to be the single best item on Wyvern.
                      Double Winter's Curse was once a nearly guaranteed to win
                      a teamfight on its own, especially in games with farmed
                      enemy physical damage cores. You should default to
                      Refresher AND turn to it when all else fails, especially
                      because it combos so well with other beneficial active
                      items like Blink, Sheepstick, BKB, etc. The huge amount
                      of mana regen it provides is yet another reason why
                      Refresher is an attractive early pickup on Wyvern—moreso
                      than perhaps nearly any hero in the game.

                      use of the attack speed, the active ability is usually
                      wasted without a teammate like Axe to throw the static
                      charge on, and thus Mjollnir is not usually the most
                      cost effective item choice until you're nearly six-slotted.

                      Despite the fact that Wyvern is a great life-saving hero
                      who can make good use of BoTs II early, they're just too
                      expensive of an investment to get any earlier than dead

                      Night vision is already a Wyvern specialty thanks to the
                      bonus night vision from Arctic Burn, but by adding Moon
                      Shard she can initiate from an even longer distance at
                      night. Moon Shard also provides the highest attack speed
                      in a single slot with none of the downsides of Mask of
                      Madness—making it by far the best option for affordable
                      damage on a Carry Wyvern after Daedalus, or as an option
                      after Necrobook/Orchid if going for more of a utility

                      Far from being the key item that makes you a threat, Hurricane
                      Pike on Wyvern is a weird item because it may keep you alive
                      in some situation, but even as an escape it's somewhat undesirable.
                      You would like to fly OVER the trees to escape with Arctic Burn,
                      but since Force Staff knocks them over you may want to avoid
                      Force Staffing into the trees. Pike doesn't provide enough damage,
                      attack speed or mana/mana regen to make it worthwhile on its own,
                      so for these reasons it's really only useful to Wyvern when she
                      needs a second (or third) escape and Blink/Arctic Burn/Linken's
                      won't cut it.

                      no other item Wyvern would want—plus the Skadi effect is
                      extremely effective at kiting enemies. Wyvern already excels
                      against physical damage dealers, but with Skadi's
                      additional 35% movespeed slow, Wyvern becomes perhaps the best
                      kiting hero in the game.

            • Since I started tracking it, Wyvern has shifted more and more towards
              the 5-position in professional play. This is a step backwards from
              what I pointed out as the trend when I first wrote this guide—that
              Wyverns who got a higher percentage of their team's net worth tended
              to win more often.<br>
          </div><!--/.row-->
          <div class="row padded" style="padding-top: 8px;">
            • There is no recent data to support this trend, as you can see below
              from this "Winrate Bar" graph I've assembled from the results of
              pro Wyvern players at the two most recent Majors.<br>

            • As more 7.00 data comes in from pub and amateur/online tournament
              results there may be a chance to support this guide with winrate
              data—but even in my own play I still find that the biggest obstacle
              to core Wyvern is your team's acceptance. You need them to accept

            • At this point running Corevern is a pocket strat. You need your
              teammates to coordinate with you in picks and in gameplan.
              Without it you might embarass yourself, and me. Don't embarass
              me. Don't forego your support duties if your team needs a support
              after some dumbass last picks Anti-Mage, and likewise as a
              support Wyvern don't turn your brain off and completely skip
              damage when your team could use some.<br>
            <h4>Pick Rate by Role</h4>

            • As players start to realize just how versatile Wyvern can be, I
              predict she will see play on every role, from offlane to carry.
              She remains a strong 5-position, but with her combination of
              reliable early farming into late-game damage, many former greedy
              support-Wyvern players will transition into playing her as a
              Corevern.

                Whether or not Wyvern can win mid depends on the matchup and
                both teams' supports—against a smart enough opponent you always
                run the risk of being countered by an aggressive support camping
                mid, for instance. The biggest adversary of mid Wyvern in a pub
                setting, however, is usually your own team tilting. Don't insta-lock
                Wyvern mid unless you're a 5-stack looking to cheese it up with
                Drow Ranger, but being forceful and expressing to your team
                that you have a plan is usually the only way to make it work in
                a pub.

              <h4><img src="img/40px-Soul_Ring_icon.png" width="32px"> Offlane (3)</h4>
                While dual offlane Wyvern as a support is not uncommon, as a
                Corevern you'll find both solo offlane and dual with a tanky
                brawler can work. You should only go for this kind of lane
                setup when it would benefit your draft to do so: make sure you
                have a hard carry and a mid getting farm, focus on shutting
                down the enemy safelaner especially if you're in a dual lane of
                your own, and focus on building damage so you can semi-carry.
                Making it to level 20 for the GPM talent is all you really
                need in some cases.

                If you want to make the quickest transition from a "support"
                position Wyvern to a Corevern, roaming is the quickest way to
                get rich and probably the most profitable—but also the least
                reliable. With practice, or if you're Sonneiko, roaming Wyvern
                can be very deadly. Some roaming Wyverns especially like to max
                Arctic Burn over Splinter Blast if they get going snowballing
                hard enough. No matter how badly the roaming turns out, so
                long as you start with Boots and a ward and make it to level 20
                the game will work out alright for Wyvern.

              <h4><img src="img/40px-Bottle_icon.png" width="32px"> Safelane (1 or 5)</h4>
                Hard carry Wyvern is a risky prospect because her steroid just
                isn't as good as some other carries. For this reason you don't
                want your opponent to know that Wyvern is your carry in a
                draft, or else they can take advantage of it. Putting aside
                this risk, the safelane is still a perfectly reasonable place
                to start out as a Corevern. Even before talents I've played
                Wyvern games where I ended up the most farmed without stealing
                farm carries. It all comes down to your ability to draw out the
                game and clear creepwaves better than most heroes. Hard Carry
                Wyvern is probably the "ideal" build 0.001% of the time, but if
                you want to chase that game AND have fun, be serious about it
                and be sure to pick some cheese with your Corevern.
