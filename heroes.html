              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Proteus is a fast-paced support hero whose abilities allow it
                to quickly get in and out of combat, using Jet, while also
                repositioning allies/enemies with Razorwind and providing burst
                damage or a damage shield with Polyp. Proteus's ultimate,
                Rarefaction, grants reduced non-ultimate cooldowns to allies
                nearby, making Proteus a useful pick in strategies that involve
                grouping up and teamfighting.

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                As Maelrawn's tentacle was lopped off by Admiral Kunkka, she
                screamed in agony and, enraged, discarded the appendage to
                settle to the barren sea floor. Forgotten as quickly as a
                replacement grew in, the flesh slowly decayed amongst the ocean
                detritus. Some spark still coursed through those veins
                though—an immense life force by any standard—and after many
                monsoon seasons the limb erupted in a fit of growth; the beast
                called Proteus emerged, renewed, from its preserved state.
                Knowing only its current form, but aware that it had barely
                survived some ordeal, Proteus was now aware of its own
                mortality and was thus determined to survive in this unfamiliar
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proteus's wanderings began innocently, but quickly turned to
                fear and pain. The benevolent beast terrified all that it came
                across, and, as legend of this sea monster spread from sandy
                shore to deep city, both man and mer mounted hunting parties to
                eradicate Proteus, for prize and glory. No harbor was safe as
                the Merinth trackers and Claddish treasure fleet chased poor
                Proteus, weaving through knotted mangroves and blackest
                trenches. Cornered at last in an alcove along the Redwater
                Reef, Proteus foresaw its own doom. As the harpoons arced down,
                meant to puncture its mantle and kill Maelrawn's sole
                offspring, something happened.  Involuntarily, Proteus awakened
                its most powerful reflex—its survival instinct.  With one
                massive blast of water, the murderous host went surging
                downward, drowned, while Proteus went soaring above the ocean
                surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                With new power coursing through its veins, Proteus now
                understood its purpose in life and so emerged from the quiet
                sea to find the source of its life force. On a journey now to
                find its mother Maelrawn, Proteus crosses land and sea unafraid
                and unstoppable.
              </p>
              <h4>Appearance</h4>
              <p>
                A serpentine sea monster whose appearance is that of a vast
                octopus, floating above the ground using its jets for
                propulsion and its tentacles to strike. Its attack animation is
                a slash with one of the front two tentacles, which sends out a
                blade-shaped bit of wind. Its skin is covered with mysterious
                patterns of deep blue dapples and cyan veins that course with
                power, while its eyes and the aura from its ultimate glow a
                bright ember orange. (<i>Everything about the hero is
                intentionally genderless but I anticipate it being voiced by a
                female and most often referred to as female</i>)

* Rarefaction bonus damage taken decreased from 40% to 33%

v2.0 (Nov 2015):

* Updated Polyp mechanism: *previously* used to block no damage and accumulate slowly until the host attacks or being knocked off by attacking the host a fixed number of times, *now* the Polyp's health is used to prevent incoming damage OR be expended as a single burst of damage, and the Polyp constantly regens. 

* Reduced Polyp cast range from 1200 to 800, and restored old mana/cooldown values

* Reverted experimental Jet changes, and increased Jet distance from 250/300/350/400 to 240/360/480/600

* Increased Rarefaction bonus damage taken from 20% to 40%, and added scaling aura radius from 900 to 900/1200/1500.

v1.21 (Sept 2013):

* Adjust Jet to now apply a strong dispel to allies Proteus passes through, as opposed to Proteus being able to cast it while CCed. Also increase cooldown and increase manacost to compensate.

* Rescaled Polyp max damage from 200/300/400/500 to 150/250/350/450

* Further tweaks in lore

v1.2 (May 2013):

v1.10 (April 2013):

* Entered and won the [r/dota2 *Create Your Own Hero* Contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1di7oz/so_finally_its_prizes_time_create_your_own_hero/)

              **LORE:**

A growing unrest was spreading across the Kingdom of Slom. Forests heaved and fauna scrambled for cover as if some wavelike disturbance swept forth, its epicenter at the Mount of Antares—a crag some ten leagues from Slom's once great capitol. After Karroch the Beastmaster freed the king's menagerie many winters ago, it was in that very capitol that the king himself was then struck by the Mad Scepter, and eventually ordered himself beheaded. Anticipating halcyon days ahead, the formerly-warlike kin of Slom had only just begun getting used to the idea of peace and quiet. Their unrest, however, was palpable. Like a black wave through her trees, carried on the wind, some force was causing all life in the land to behave... oddly. Animals became suddenly vicious, with reports of shepherds devoured by their own flocks. Even the vinters noted that their famous muscadine had turned dark, as if the land itself was poisoned.

The people clamored for Karroch to investigate, but there was simply no way to reach the Beastmaster. Karroch had departed on a journey to find one particular Beast, and told the people not to expect his return for many winters hence. As the season dragged on and foodstuffs depleted, the freemen of Slom began to lose hope. Starvation hit their youngest first, and yet from this hopelessness arose a new spark. One youngster, about the age that Karroch himself had been when he became a hero, decided to sojourn to the Mount himself, hoping to learn this blight's cause.

As the boy summited the crag and looked out over the forests below, he saw something moving among the motionless landscape below. A magnificent stag suddenly lept forth from the canopy, scaling the Mount's great height with a single jump. The boy could feel that it radiated forth some kind of power—an energy that runs counter to that of the darkness he had come there to defeat. The boy felt a strong connection to the stag—almost an invitation—and so hopped on its back to make the last leg of his journey. He nocked an arrow on the bow he had brought with him, and, hands quavering wildly, rounded the corner to see a shocking sight: Karroch's Beast! After a silent moment the Beast opened its eyes—crusted with a thick black film—and leered viciously at the boy. He heard a terrible rumbling voice in his head: "I am Antares," said the Beast, telepathically. "Leave here or you and your stag will be my next meal." Without any command by the boy, his mount began to charge the Beast, and the boy knew what he must do. Hands steady at last, he loosed a spiraling shot at the Beast—hitting it dead between the eyes!

At once the boy could feel change, as suddenly the Mount started to crumble around him. Turning to leave, he heard the frenzied calls of a hawk from the corner of the cave grotto. Rushing over to investigate, the boy found Karroch, barely conscious, restrained behind the Beast's throne, and with him his hawk. Though the boy was not sure how, he managed free the Beastmaster just in time for them both to escape. For the heroic rescue of his town, the boy was given the name Antares in honor of the evil he had vanquished; for the daring rescue of Karroch, the revelation that he had saved his own father.

<h4>Appearance</h4>

A boy riding a magnificently large, noble stag. He wields a simple bow and wears garb similar to Beastmaster's, while the stag is orangey-red in hue and glows around his hooves, antlers and eyes. The boy, Antares, has donned the same face paint as Beastmaster, but lacks the horns and beard of his father. His stag has an elaborate pattern of zodiac-like constellations etched in its fur, which glow purple and give off a mist of purple particles while Antares' passive Kinetic Shroud is active.

                him cover on the high ground. The spire slowly crumbles over the spire's
                duration, dealing damage over time then crashing down at the end of the

                Upon cast, destroys trees in the target radius and instantly elevates all
                units within its radius up one "level" of height, wherein a hero in the river
                that gets elevated will see up to the level of the mid towers, and so on. The

                If Eruption is cast near a cliff, any locations where the plateau meets the

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                Some sea monsters are simply not meant to be caught. Or so they
                once said of the greatest sea terror ever, the dastardly whelk
                Proteus. Well, they were wrong. It takes a special breed of
                hunter—one with patience, cunning, AND that rare trait of
                tenacity—but eventually Sulliver managed to track down and
                nearly kill the twelve oceans' most-sought-after sea-beastie.
                His harpoon was mere inches from the beast's mantle when he
                felt a pang of sadness—remorse, even. He almost felt bad for
                the bloke, for just one second.  You see, after spending so
                many sleepless nights haunting around reefs chasing someone—mer
                or monster or otherwise—you almost feel like he (or it, I
                suppose) becomes a part of you. A wee part of you. And it was
                that moment of hesitation that let the biggest prize he would
                have ever taken down escape.

                Since that day, Sulliver the Merinth Tracker has taken pride in
                never letting a single mark escape. Driven by greed and the
                thrill of the hunt, he'll hunt anything from convicts to
                sea-creatures if the prize is large enough. With uncanny
                timing, startling agility and his trademark technique of slowly
                sapping his enemy's power, the Merinth Tracker can and will
                chase down any foe.

                spear. Algae and barnacles cover his shell armor. Runs with his
