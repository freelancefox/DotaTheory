              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Proteus is a fast-paced support hero whose abilities allow it
                to quickly get in and out of combat, using Jet, while also
                repositioning allies/enemies with Razorwind and providing burst
                damage or a damage shield with Polyp. Proteus's ultimate,
                Rarefaction, grants reduced non-ultimate cooldowns to allies
                nearby, making Proteus a useful pick in strategies that involve
                grouping up and teamfighting.

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                As Maelrawn's tentacle was lopped off by Admiral Kunkka, she
                screamed in agony and, enraged, discarded the appendage to
                settle to the barren sea floor. Forgotten as quickly as a
                replacement grew in, the flesh slowly decayed amongst the ocean
                detritus. Some spark still coursed through those veins
                though—an immense life force by any standard—and after many
                monsoon seasons the limb erupted in a fit of growth; the beast
                called Proteus emerged, renewed, from its preserved state.
                Knowing only its current form, but aware that it had barely
                survived some ordeal, Proteus was now aware of its own
                mortality and was thus determined to survive in this unfamiliar
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proteus's wanderings began innocently, but quickly turned to
                fear and pain. The benevolent beast terrified all that it came
                across, and, as legend of this sea monster spread from sandy
                shore to deep city, both man and mer mounted hunting parties to
                eradicate Proteus, for prize and glory. No harbor was safe as
                the Merinth trackers and Claddish treasure fleet chased poor
                Proteus, weaving through knotted mangroves and blackest
                trenches. Cornered at last in an alcove along the Redwater
                Reef, Proteus foresaw its own doom. As the harpoons arced down,
                meant to puncture its mantle and kill Maelrawn's sole
                offspring, something happened. Involuntarily, Proteus awakened
                its most powerful reflex—its survival instinct. With one
                massive blast of water, the murderous host went surging
                downward, drowned, while Proteus went soaring above the ocean
                surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                With new power coursing through its veins, Proteus now
                understood its purpose in life and so emerged from the quiet
                sea to find the source of its life force. On a journey now to
                find its mother Maelrawn, Proteus crosses land and sea unafraid
                and unstoppable.
              </p>
              <h4>Appearance</h4>
              <p>
                A serpentine sea monster whose appearance is that of a vast
                octopus, floating above the ground using its jets for
                propulsion and its tentacles to strike. Its attack animation is
                a slash with one of the front two tentacles, which sends out a
                blade-shaped bit of wind. Its skin is covered with mysterious
                patterns of deep blue dapples and cyan veins that course with
                power, while its eyes and the aura from its ultimate glow a
                bright ember orange. (<i>Everything about the hero is
                intentionally genderless but I anticipate it being voiced by a
                female and most often referred to as female</i>)

                      Polyps do not stack with each other. Casting a second
                      Polyp on an ally has no effect (unless the Polyp's health
                      was at less than its base health, at which point the new
                      Polyp will override) but still puts the spell on
                      cooldown.

                    <li>
                      At level 1, Proteus can place up to 2 Polyps on allies
                      and use them to deal maximum damage during a 12 second
                      window where they're both fully charged. With levels 2,
                      3 and 4 Polyp this increases to 3 max Polyps in an 8s
                      window, 4 max Polyps in a 13s window, and 5 max Polyps
                      in a 12s window respectively.
                    <li>
                      With level 3 ultimate, Proteus can extend this window up
                      to ~21s, although the Polyps lose their ability to regenerate
                      health upon reaching full capacity.

                    <li>
                      Polyps are indicated visually by an additional light blue

                      Polyp hovering above the target.

                    causing itself to take bonus damage from all sources.

                      Stacks with Octarine Core cooldown reduction, just like
                      Arcane Rune does. Unlike Octarine Core, however, where
                      the target must be in the AoE when casting the spell to
                      receive the effect, Rarefaction simply begins speeding up
                      any cooldowns when an ally comes in range of the aura.
                      The effect ends when allies leave the aura's radius.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added Talents
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reduce Razorwind cast range from 700/800/900/1000 to
                  500/600/700/800, reducing the base max push distance
                  from 700/750/800/850 to 600/650/700/750.

              <p>v2.5 (Nov 2016):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Title updated from "Kraken Offspring" to "Kraken Spawn"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Update Polyp mechanics after gameplay testing: Polyp now
                  has a max duration of 50 seconds, leading to a maximum
                  window for Polyp's damage to take effect, in effect limiting
                  you to 2/3/4/5 possible max Polyps at a time. Polyps also
                  now stop regening upon reaching full HP. Polyp bonus damage
                  explicitly does not affect buildings.

                  Added clarification to Polyp description, and added
                  BKB/Linkens/Purgable icons to skills
                </li>
                <li>Fixed gender pronouns in Appearance and added note about gender</li>

                  Changed Rarefaction bonus damage taken scaling from 33% to

                <li>
                  Update Polyp base health scaling from 50 to 50/75/100/125,
                  Polyp max health from 150/250/350/450 to 150/225/300/375, and
                  Polyp regen from 5/10/15/20 to 5/10/20/25 (Full charge time

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated Polyp mechanism: *previously* used to block no damage
                  and accumulate slowly until the host attacks or being knocked
                  off by attacking the host a fixed number of times, *now* the
                  polyp's health is used to prevent incoming damage or be
                  expended as a single burst of damage, and the polyp constantly
                  regens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reduced Polyp cast range from 1200 to 800, and restored old
                  mana/cooldown values
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reverted experimental Jet changes, and increased Jet
                  distance from 250/300/350/400 to 240/360/480/600
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increased Rarefaction bonus damage taken from 20% to 40%,
                  and added scaling aura radius from 900 to 900/1200/1500.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Adjust Jet to now apply a strong dispel to allies Proteus
                  passes through, as opposed to Proteus being able to cast it
                  while CCed. Also increase cooldown and increase manacost to
                  compensate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reworked Polyp to scale from 1 attack to 1/1/2/3 attacks, and
                  removed the Polyp-knocking-off mechanic.
                </li>
                <li>Rescaled Polyp max damage from 200/300/400/500 to 150/250/350/450</li>

                <li>
                  Polyp can now target allies, instead of just Proteus itself.
                  Polyps are also no longer removed by attacks but do not
                  gather damage for 3/2.5/2/1.5 seconds after an instance of
                  20+ hero damage

                  as many from creeps to 2/3/4/5 of any attack, since creeps
                  will never target the Polyps unless controlled by a hero

                Antares is a terrain-dependent agility carry that
                heavily relies on magical damage, thanks to his ultimate
                Kinetic Charge which increases his movement speed, agility
                and magic amplification the longer he moves without stopping.
                Thanks to his mount he can fly over ledges and cliffs while
                stunning enemies with Cliff Jump, summon a temporary plateau
                that deals damage with Eruption, and finish off fleeing enemies
                with his long-range nuke Sidewinder.

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                A growing unrest was spreading across the Kingdom of Slom.
                Forests heaved and fauna scrambled for cover as if some wavelike
                disturbance swept forth, its epicenter at the Mount of Antares—a
                crag some ten leagues from Slom's once great capitol. After
                karroch the beastmaster freed the king's menagerie many winters
                ago, it was in that very capitol that the king himself was then
                struck by the mad scepter, and eventually ordered himself
                beheaded. Anticipating halcyon days ahead, the formerly-warlike
                kin of Slom had only just begun getting used to the idea of peace
                and quiet. Their unrest, however, was palpable. Like a black
                wave through her trees, carried on the wind, some force was
                causing all life in the land to behave... oddly. Animals became
                suddenly vicious, with reports of shepherds devoured by their own
                flocks. Even the vinters noted that their famous muscadine had
                turned dark, as if the land itself was poisoned.
              </p>
              <p>
                The people clamored for Karroch to investigate, but there was
                simply no way to reach the beastmaster. Karroch had departed on a
                journey to find one particular beast, and told the people not
                to expect his return for many winters hence. As the season
                dragged on and foodstuffs depleted, the freemen of Slom began
                to lose hope. Starvation hit their youngest first, and yet
                from this hopelessness arose a new spark. one youngster, about
                the age that Karroch himself had been when he became a hero,
                decided to sojourn to the mount himself, hoping to learn this
                blight's cause.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the boy summited the crag and looked out over the forests
                below, he saw something moving among the motionless landscape
                below. A magnificent stag suddenly lept forth from the canopy,
                scaling the mount's great height with a single jump. The boy
                could feel that it radiated forth some kind of power—an energy
                that runs counter to that of the darkness he had come there to
                defeat. The boy felt a strong connection to the stag—almost an
                invitation—and so hopped on its back to make the last leg of
                his journey. He nocked an arrow on the bow he had brought with
                him, and, hands quavering wildly, rounded the corner to see a
                shocking sight: Karroch's beast! After a silent moment the
                beast opened its eyes—crusted with a thick black film—and
                leered viciously at the boy. He heard a terrible rumbling voice
                in his head: "I am Antares," said the beast, telepathically.
                "Leave here or you and your Stag will be my next meal." Without
                any command by the boy, his mount began to charge the beast,
                and the boy knew what he must do. Hands steady at last, he
                loosed a spiraling shot at the beast—hitting it dead between
                the eyes!
              </p>
              <p>
                At once the boy could feel change, as suddenly the Mount
                started to crumble around him. Turning to leave, he heard the
                frenzied calls of a hawk from the corner of the cave grotto.
                Rushing over to investigate, the boy found Karroch, barely
                conscious, restrained behind the beast's throne, and with him
                his hawk. Though the boy was not sure how, he managed free the
                Beastmaster just in time for them both to escape. For the
                heroic rescue of his town, the boy was given the name Antares
                in honor of the evil he had vanquished; for the daring rescue
                of Karroch, the revelation that he had saved his own father.

                A boy riding a magnificently large, noble stag. He wields a
                simple bow and wears garb similar to beastmaster's, while the
                stag is orangey-red in hue and glows around his hooves, antlers
                and eyes. The boy, antares, has donned the same face paint as
                beastmaster, but lacks the horns and beard of his father. His
                stag has an elaborate pattern of zodiac-like constellations
                etched in its fur, which glow purple and give off a mist of
                purple particles while antares' passive kinetic charge is
                active.

              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Merinth Tracker is a unique blend of greed and intellect, able
                to farm swiftly thanks to a percentage gold boost from kills he
                gets with his stun Harpoon, all the while zipping around the
                map thanks to his ultimate, Hydroplane, which grants him
                incredible movement speed in the river or wherever his first
                spell, Water Sprite, goes first. His unique role as a melee
                intelligence carry comes from his skills as a tracker, wielding
                an extra-long melee attack range, the aura provided by his
                Sprite granting up to 50% lifesteal on all damage, including
                spells, and his last spell, Mana Wave, which allows him to
                restore allied mana while burning it from enemies.

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                Some sea monsters are simply not meant to be caught. Or so they
                once said of the greatest sea terror ever, the dastardly whelk
                Proteus. Well, they were wrong. It takes a special breed of
                hunter—one with patience, cunning, AND that rare trait of
                tenacity—but eventually Sulliver managed to track down and
                nearly kill the twelve oceans' most-sought-after sea-beastie.
                His harpoon was mere inches from the beast's mantle when he
                felt a pang of sadness—remorse, even. He almost felt bad for
                the bloke, for just one second. You see, after spending so
                many sleepless nights haunting around reefs chasing someone—mer
                or monster or otherwise—you almost feel like he (or it, I
                suppose) becomes a part of you. A wee part of you. And it was
                that moment of hesitation that let the biggest prize he would
                have ever taken down escape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since that day, Sulliver the Merinth Tracker has taken pride in
                never letting a single mark escape. Driven by greed and the
                thrill of the hunt, he'll hunt anything from convicts to
                sea-creatures if the prize is large enough. With uncanny
                timing, startling agility and his trademark technique of slowly
                sapping his enemy's power, the Merinth Tracker can and will
                chase down any foe.
              </p>
              <h4>Appearance</h4>
              <p>
                Scaley male naga with lanky form, tall headpiece, tribal beads
                and garb, shoulder guard, armored belt, and a long trident-like
                spear. Algae and barnacles cover his shell armor. Runs with his
                crab legs but rides a small wave while hydroplaning.

              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Arcturyx is a new breed of agility carry, similar to others
                who rely on magic damage but eschewing physical damage nearly
                entirely in the form of two main nukes that rely on stats and
                deal pure damage in the form of Railgun and Broadside respectively.
                His kit also offers a supportive mobility skill, Arc Boost, which
                lets Arcturyx save allies or make dangerous dives of his own.
                His ultimate, Prismatic Wings, ties it all together by
                reflecting enemy spells and attacks while active, turning
                Arcturyx's health and mana pools into a giant Armlet-like
                battery that discharges and must then recharge.

              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                Before he became Arcturyx, he was once a test subject in a
                secret Keen-folk weapons program, recruited as a child for
                displaying psychic abilities.  One day he woke up with amnesia,
                grafted to a machine and reborn as a sentient bird with
                firearms and futuristic military technology that deflects magic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arcturyx's life was difficult from day one. He woke up on a
                burned battlefield, fallen from a passing airship—perhaps. Or,
                barely escaped from some far away mad scientist's coop. Or a
                weapon for some mad king. Either way, Arcturyx now longed for a
                roost, and decided to fly North.  Arcturyx flew over the
                Wailing Mountains, finding no suitable homestead there in the
                high craggy peaks, and so banked upward and into the clouds.
                Rising up to the levels of the highest snow-capped peaks,
                Arcturyx turned the corner around a hazy bank of ice clouds
                when WHAM a shot rang out in the distance. Quickly he soared
                toward the sound's source, when all of a sudden came into view
                the ramparts of a distant walled fortress, looming above a
                sheer drop some thousands of feet into the clouds below.
                Arcturyx peered through the clouds to where he spied some sort
                of engagement happening in the air above it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zooming his view closer, Arcturyx identified what looked like
                several birds with similar armaments to his own: cannons and
                the like, encircling and attacking a convoy of airships
                protected by a flock of Buzz Copters. As Arcturyx approached
                quickly he realized he should enter the fray, but then paused.
                He couldn't even remember who these other birds were, or
                whether those ships they were attacking held innocent
                civilians—or untold treasures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arcturyx sailed past the sortie a first time, then caught an
                updraft and banked upward above the fracas. He peered down and
                wondered whether he was meant to be fighting those copters.
                Arcturyx certainly didn't want to any more. He wanted
                desperately to fight his own enemies, and find out who made
                him. He banked back towards the fortress and went looking for
                its owner. Though he found no resolution there in the fortress
                that day, Arcturyx would go on to recover scraps of his old
                life, thoughts reoccuring to him as dreams or flashes at odd
                moments. He was a boy once. He remembered the lab where they
                eventually bade him into a machine to fuse with the weapons
                system, and fragments of the experiments they put him through.
                Now he wants answers even more than before—the question is
                what he'll have to do to find them.
              </p>
              <h4>Appearance</h4>
              <p>
                A biomechanical bird brought to life by a mad scientist. Huge
                steel-plated wings with crackling pads of energy that provide
                lift, and project a holographic field while Arcturyx's ultimate
                is active. Two main cannons on either shoulder remain at a 45
                degree angle to be used for firing Broadside cannon rounds to
                either side, and to fire its primary Railgun Arcturyx elongates
                its tail and opens its beak. Auto-attacks are yellow bolts of
                energy thrown from its wing-tips. Arc Boosted targets gain a trail
                of spiraling particles as they whoosh forward. Arcturyx's
                colorful plumage is not made from actual feathers but from
                yellow and magenta sparks as the wind and enemy attacks deflect
                off of his advanced armor.

                      reduced by items, blocked by BKB and most importantly
                      reduced by Arc Boost.

              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Goldwing is a new breed of agility carry, similar to others
                who rely on magic damage but eschewing physical damage nearly
                entirely in the form of two main nukes that rely on stats and
                deal pure damage in the form of Railgun and Broadside respectively.
                His kit also offers a supportive mobility skill, Arc Boost, which
                lets Goldwing save allies or make dangerous dives of his own.
                His ultimate, Prismatic Wings, ties it all together by
                reflecting enemy spells and attacks while active, turning
                Goldwing's health and mana pools into a giant Armlet-like
                battery that discharges and must then recharge.

                      order to synthesize the amount of gold you need.

                      Selling and rebuying the same item does not reset
                      cooldowns for Goldwing unless he is at a physical shop,
                      otherwise the item will just have the same cooldown as
                      before rebuying. Essentially, every item retains its
                      cooldown even after selling unless he physically buys a
                      new one from the shopkeeper.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Added Talents
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added base damage to Cash Out if Goldwing makes money
                </li>
                <li>
                  Goldwing Suit now grants +3/9/12 backpack slots for a total
                  of 6/12/18 rather than allowing access to the stash globally
                </li>
                <li>
                  Renamed 'Stash Swap' to 'Pack Swap'
                </li>
                <li>
                  Items in the stash when you die under ultimate are safe now
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increased Rebuy cooldown from 0s to 6/5/4s (to control GPM
                  gain from synthesizing items and selling them rapidly)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Decreased Physical Shop Discount from Goldwing Suit from 5/10/15% to 2/4/6%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At level 6 Goldwing now gains up to 1.02 ^ 10 = 1.2189 times
                  his Net Worth (NW) per minute from rapidly buying and selling
                  items at a physical shop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At level 12 Goldwing gains up to 1.04 ^ 12 = 1.601 * NW per minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At level 18 Goldwing gains up to 1.06 ^ 15 = 2.39 * NW per minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At level 25 with the +6% Physical Shop Discount talent he can
                  synthesize up to 1.12 ^ 15 = 5.473 times his NW per minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These calculations all assume that you're able to cast
                  Rebuy/Cash Out perfectly once every 6/5/4 seconds, and that
                  you're constantly selling items equal to your total Net Worth
                  (which is impossible, hence actual efficiency depends on your
                  ability to spend all of your money quickly and properly
                  rotate through the cooldowns).

ldwing may not purchase or wield Divine Rapier, but Gem however behaves normally.
