      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        There's lots of other guides out there—my goal is to only present
        truly <b>new</b> ideas. My builds will always be what I think is
        mathematically optimal, even when that doesn't line up with what's
        popular. In fact, that's exactly when I make a guide.
      </p>
      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hi I'm Jon, aka freelance, a 23yo Software Engineer from Florida.
        My favorite thing about Dota is that feeling of innovation when
        something clever works, and after coming up with several ideas
        I feel could have really impacted the meta I decided I should
        share them. Although not necessarily intended for newer players,
        practically anyone can benefit from what I would call the
        <i>scientific approach</i> to Dota that I teach. One of my
        beliefs, for example, is that item order and itemization in
        general can be viewed as an equation with a set solution or
        solutions—perhaps one day we can come up with an algorithm
        to do it for us. Until then, we need to look deeper than just
        winrates and professional trends to find answers—which
        is something I hope I can inspire others to do as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Playstyle</h3>
      <p>
        I started playing in November 2011, shortly after TI1, and
        calibrated at 3.5k shortly after the MMR system was released.
        I've never really cared much about MMR, and the objectively
        worse quality of ranked games has driven me to mostly play
        unranked RD (my favorite mode). I watch massive amounts of
        pro Dota though, many times more than I've played. In general,
        I love drafting and favor playmaking cores and sometimes
        supports, but not hard carries or hard supports. I play a lot
        of mid but I'm more of a team player, although my hero pool
        tends more towards Dendi/s4 than your hard carry mid players.
        These days I haven't been playing as frequently so I'm not as
        well rounded, but if I ever get to climbing or streaming I'm
        sure that can be fixed!

      <h3>Collab</h3>
      <p>
        I'm looking for contributors to this project in two areas:
        authors with unique ideas about Dota and the ability to
        articulate them, and software devs with a background in Dota.
        One huge requirement is a familiarity with, or demonstrable
        willingness to learn, <a href="https://github.com/freelancefox/freelancefox.github.io"><b>git</b></a>, which is being used as the
        backbone of this website. Git makes contributing to this
        project easy if you know it, but even if you don't I will
        make an effort to help you learn if you contact me and I
        like your ideas otherwise. The main point is this: reach
        out to me on Twitter or Reddit, let me know what you're
        interested in, and maybe this crazy project will grow!
      </p>
      <h3>Casting</h3>
      <p>
        I casted a couple small local LANs back in 2014, and
        have attempted to cover a few small online events with no
        English coverage since then. The main reason I haven't
        casted more regularly is that I want to develop software
        to provide a better user interface more than I want to
        just simply cast. Such is the curse of being a software
        engineer. If anyone <i>wants</i> to work with me in the
        meantime, reach out.
