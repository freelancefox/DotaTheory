              The intended purpose of this guide is to share how I,
              the author, personally enjoy playing Sand King. There
              are many ways to play Sand King, and some people might
              dislike some of my choices, but I try to clearly note
              spots where you can diverge to other playstyles, and
              do talk about the pros and cons of this style versus some
              of the other builds. Please send any relevant feedback

            <h3>Before You Start</h3>
            <div class="row padded">
              Sand King is a relatively unforgiving hero for newer
              players, relying on positioning and game sense to make
              predictive plays and execute difficult teamfight combos.
              His ultimate is just straight up hard to use. Be sure to practice
              your basic combos and any jungling patterns you plan to use
              before playing any live games your first time on Sand King, and
              for newer players especially be careful with the short range of
              your main spell, Burrowstrike. Last-hitting with Caustic Finale can
              sometimes be finicky, so practicing this is a good idea as well.

              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Sand King is a Strength hero with abilities that requires
                him to get close to enemies and attack them, but unlike
                a carry hero does not primarily deal damage by attacking
                during an engagement. Sand King's main role is to
                provide lockdown with his signature spell: Burrowstrike.
                It provides damage and mobility along with a hard stun,
                all in one package, supplemented by his other spells: Sand
                Storm to provide jungling ability and a second escape, his
                ultimate Epicenter to deal tons of magic damage, and his
                passive Caustic Finale, which allows Sand King to flash
                farm quicker than most heroes.
              </p>
              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                The sands of the Scintillant Waste are alive and sentient--the
                whole vast desert speaks to itself, thinking thoughts only such a
                vastness can conceive. But when it needs to find a form to
                communicate with those of more limited scope, it frees a fragment
                of itself, and fills a carapace of magic armor formed by the
                cunning Djinn of Qaldin. This essential identity calls itself
                Crixalis, meaning 'Soul of the Sand,' but others know it as Sand
                King.  Sand King takes the form of a huge arachnid, inspired by
                the Scintillant Waste's small but ubiquitous denizens; and this
                is a true outward expression of his ferocious nature.  Guardian,
                warrior, ambassador--Sand King is all of these things,
                inseparable from the endless desert that gave him life.

            <h3>Why Sand King?</h3>
            <div id="picks" class="row padded">
              Sand King is without a doubt one of the most fun heroes to play
              and watch due to his play-making abilities—plus he has also received nothing but
              straight buffs for years—but why, then, are more players not
              picking him? There seems to be some confusion amongst players,
              even pros, about what his strengths are as a hero—not everyone
              seems to think that his most buffed, and indeed most important
              spell is his passive, Caustic Finale. Some pro players still may
              not pick it up at all, opting to jungle with exclusively Sand
              Storm. Along with recent buffs there has been something of a
              streak of Sand King picks in competitive play lately, giving us
              a glimpse into the playstyle that core Sand King takes on in high
              level games in the hands of flashy players such as OG.Miracle and
              Na'vi Dendi both in the past few months, for example, as well as
              8 safelane solo Sand King picks in the Manila Major Qualifiers.
              Despite the variety of builds we've seen, there is no one team
              taking full advantage of SK's strengths as I think they currently
              stand. This guide aims to carve out a new, stronger niche for
              core Sand King, based on the three following factors:
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div id="picks" class="row padded">
              <h4 style="margin-top: 8px;"><img src="img/sandking_caustic_finale.png"> Early Kill Potential</h4>
              • The ability to blow up a creep wave with Burrowstrike plus Caustic
                Finale is one of the most underrated early game combos there is in
                terms of kill and harass potential. The following chart shows damage
                after reductions for up to a whole normal wave of four creeps proccing
                Caustic, shown below with levels 1-8 taking straight Burrow-Caustic
                4-0-4-0 (<i>not a recommended build, but just for example</i>):<br>
              <div id="blast"></div>
              • Using Caustic is a matter of both farming and aggression, your goal
                is to play a game of chicken, calmly whittling down your opponent
                until you can burst them down before they realize it's too late. You
                deal damage to nearby enemies for each last hit, but you can also
                apply Caustic to healthy creeps and nuke down the whole wave with
                a Burrowstrike to deal one tremendous burst of damage. Enemies will
                get wise to this kind of gameplay depending on their experience and
                how aggressive you are, so mind-games will heavily impact your ability
                to coax someone into a trap to get your first kill or two.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div id="picks" class="row padded" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;">
              <h4><img src="img/sandking_burrowstrike.png"> Flash Farm + Scaling</h4>
              • Besides all the damage it can do to heroes, Burrowstrike is also an
                incredible farming tool—not to mention one of the best scaling abilities
                in the game, thanks to some recently introduced items. Burrowstrike is
                the <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="" style="white-space: nowrap;" data-original-title="The closest comparison would be Earth Spirit's Rolling Boulder, Magnus's Skewer, or Earthshaker's Enchant Totem with Aghanim's, which are the only other mobility spells that offer any form of CC.">ONLY spell in the game</a>
                that combines an escape, a nuke AND a stun. Considering how powerful
                this one spell makes Sand King, it seems absolutely crazy to me
                that some people still haven't tried itemizing him around Burrowstrike,
                like this build does.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div id="stats1"></div>
            <div id="picks" class="row padded" style="padding-bottom: 8px;">
              • The basic premise here is that we use Caustic and Burrowstrike to take
                over and flash farm a lane, then use our early farm to start snowballing.
                After taking care of the necessities that allow us to get off Epicenter (Blink), we
                then upgrade Burrowstrike, usually cooldown first followed by initiation
                range and, potentially—if we don't run out of slots—more magical damage
                in the form of items like Dagon, Eblade, or Shiva's. More supportive
                Sand Kings can go for an item like Veil that amplifies the whole team's damage,
                but as a core Sand King the key to scaling properly is focusing on large items.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div id="picks" class="row padded">
              <h4><img src="img/sandking_epicenter.png"> Huge Teamfight Damage</h4>
              • There are few heroes in the game that offer scaling AoE damage quite like
                Sand King does, and some of the others (like Earthshaker) rely on enemies
                clumping up to deal their damage. Sand King is fortunate in that he
                can safely itemize for damage-boosting items like Ethereal Blade or Aether
                Lens thanks to his built in mobility, making him especially potent at both
                teamfighting and solo-killing well into the late-game. For this reason
                you should also avoid picking Sand King into a situation where his combo
                may be disrupted, e.g. where his Blink Dagger can be canceled during
                Epicenter channeling or when he can be easily knocked out of Sand Storm
                with AoE stuns. There are other heroes that simply perform better in
                these situations.

              • When played this way, Sand King's playstyle most closesly resembles a hero like
                Puck—a mobile, aggressive, elusive teamfight controller—but with a stun
                and magic damage instead of silence and a leash. No hero matches Sand
                King's combination of hard lockdown and huge mobility, and with farm
                Sand King can dominate practically any hero, provided he has help from
                teammates, simply by using his range and low cooldown stun to prevent
                anyone from escaping.

                Sand King is highly versatile with regards to which role and
                lane he goes, but he's still a hero you want to avoid picking
                early if you can because he's somewhat counterable. Consult
                the following list of hero interactions during your drafts for
                some idea of how each matchup works, but keep in mind that some
                categories on this list refer to 1v1 matchups while others

                      SK excels against these heroes, primarily in lane but
                      also when using his combo, because the extra enemy
                      minions allow CF to be procced multiple times, granting
                      extra damage and also some free CS.

                        Although Furion (Nature's Prophet) himself is pretty
                        squishy, the primary reason why he's weak to SK is his
                        Treants. These are the potentially most numerous summon,
                        sometimes in hordes due to the NP Aghanim's upgrade. As with
                        any hero in this category, either counter Prophet in lane
                        by following him if he tries to relocate permanently, or
                        potentially disrupt his jungle as a support SK by making
                        early rotations. Playing SK in these matchups is like playing
                        Earthshaker and using Echo Slam—if you see Furion surrounded
                        by his creeps, you can easily take him down—sometimes using
                        just Burrowstrike and a Caustic attack or two.

                        Enchantress is a walking oxymoron—her low health
                        means she is especially susceptible to magic burst like
                        Epicenter, BUT she's also perhaps the most resilient
                        jungler there is.  Enchantress is extremely difficult
                        to catch or kill during the early game because of her
                        high movement speed and Untouchable—thus it is not
                        recommended to attempt roaming against any competent
                        Enchantress player.  Instead, the best way to play this
                        matchup is as a core, in lane. An early level 6,
                        whether laning against Enchantress or not, since the
                        1v1 matchup isn't as particularly strong here for the
                        SK, means an early Epicenter, which means dead Bambi.
                        Early on Enchantress is especially susceptible to magic
                        burst since her Strength is the lowest in the game. As
                        a greedy jungler, SK can potentially punish Enchantress
                        by farming his team's jungle first, and then rotating
                        to counter-gank the offlane or roaming Enchantress, but
                        this style of play is definitely most risky against an
                        Enchantress compared to other junglers.

                        This is the #1 clearest situation to pick a Sand King.
                        Many tiny spiders means SK can farm up a storm, shut
                        down the weaker Arachnid in lane, and potentially
                        snowball out of control. The key is finding the lane
                        against Broodmother—and watch out for Web tricks!
                        Look at the draft and predict the way Brood would
                        normally lane, then guess which lane she would go to if
                        trying to avoid you. The answer may sometimes be mid or
                        your team's safelane! Whatever you do, REMEMBER the
                        ONLY reason to pick SK against Brood is the lane matchup.
                        If you treat the matchup this way you'll be much more
                        successful, as Sand King lineups tend
                        to run out of steam unless another core takes over
                        or the wombo-combo teamfight is unstoppable. Brood
                        will often simply beat out the SK's team unless you can
                        feed on her early game, snowballing into her team's
                        base and taking high ground by a somewhat reasonable
                        time (30:00-40:00 minutes).

                        Enigma is one of the easiest junglers to counter-jungle
                        because he's at his most fragile during the early game—before
                        he can pick up any Mekansm or other armor items,
                        and while his Eidolons are still weak. A boots-first
                        roaming SK can hope to find a pick-off roaming into the
                        Enigma's jungle early game, while a smart core SK can
                        carry an early TP scroll starting around 4 minutes and
                        usually TP to help any lane where Enigma ganks at level 6,
                        hopefully surprising Enigma and stopping Black Hole

                        1v1, this lane is definitely a close contest for CS
                        until SK hits level 3, or maybe even level 2 if he gets
                        aggressive on Beastmaster under a creep wave
                        successfully—but the matchup tends to favor Sand King
                        overall because in late-game teamfights, he can always
                        afford to hang back and wait for the Beastmaster to go
                        in first. Hawk vision can definitely make life hard for
                        a clumsy SK caught in the trees, but always remember in
                        such situations that a little purple puff of some Smoke
                        of Deceit can make the whole play work for only 50g. If
                        you play AROUND the Beastmaster, he'll be the one

                        CK is a scary opponent in lane, especially because he often
                        brings an IO or other support with him, but in a somewhat
                        fair 1v1 Sand King can definitely still manhandle this
                        tanky brute. Against a lane with supports, hang back and
                        level Sand Storm early enough to escape their aggression,
                        as it will also let you fall back to the jungle. With
                        a decent Aghanim's timing Sand King will usually destroy
                        the CK throughout the mid-to-late game, but after fully
                        tanking up CK may just be too strong for SK to take down
                        without items like Veil and Shiva's.

                        SK excels against heroes with low strength both because
                        he wants kills from each use of Epicenter, but also
                        because each kill gives him more damage from CF, so
                        targeting a squishy enemy in a clump of other enemies
                        can sometimes lead to kills you wouldn't get otherwise.

                        anyone, but the Scintillant Sands are indeed swifter
                        than the Wolves of Icewrack—significantly enough that
                        even without Boots, a Sand King at 300 speed should be
                        able to burrow on and kill a CM at level 2 with just
                        Caustic and Burrow level 1. This goes for most of the
                        heroes in this section, though many of the others have
                        mitigating factors like mobility.

                        SK is one of the best heroes at catching heroes with

                        catch him, even with just Burrowstrike. Getting an
                        additional Eul's Scepter or Scythe of Vyse means you
                        can instantly Cyclone or Sheep, channel Epicenter, and
                        chain into your own stun. In lane, remember that Storm
                        Spirit is short-ranged, and thus is quite susceptible
                        to Caustic harass—especially when he goes in for a
                        Remnant.

                        Queen of Pain is not necessarily squishy per se, but she
                        is elusive enough to warrant counter-picking AND, unlike
                        Anti-Mage, she must turn before her Blink animation goes
                        off, leaving a Sand King who Blinks in enough time to
                        catch her out with his 2000 speed projectile. Her high
                        burst AoE damage may at some point be used to try and
                        coerce you into leaving Sand Storm, so keep in mind
                        that against heroes like QoP you must always keep an eye
                        on your health to make sure you're not making a suicidal
                        Burrow stun into the center of a teamfight. Sometimes
                        with Aghs this play can work out, since you'll also have

                        any small arms fire while you sting people, but playing
                        against magic burst heroes like QoP requires discipline
                        that even some pro Sand King players lack. Don't throw
                        your life away unless it's to actually FINISH OFF the
                        whole fight.

                        is not quite as favorable as the illusion-based heroes.
                        Attacking multiple Meepos just to apply the Caustic debuff

                        While not covered under the Weaver section, let it be said
                        here that Linken's Sphere carries like Weaver and Morphling
                        can be quite annoying for a core SK because Linken's will
                        always block Burrowstrike, even if it's not hero-targeted.
                        Bearing this in mind, it may be prudent to pick-up an
                        additional active item like Eul's against these heroes, IF
                        they go Linken's Sphere, to quickly pop their Linken's and
                        follow-through with your Burrow combo. Morphling can be
                        especially frustrating to play against because he will
                        Strength morph his way out of the fight if you don't burst
                        him, but even in these cases Sand King has the advantage
                        with a lower cooldown mobility spell and Caustic slow, so
                        long as the Morphling doesn't instantly replicate out.
                        Morphling is also low-range enough to be hit will Caustic
                        while going in for last hits himself, so for all intents
                        and purposes you can treat the Morphling 1v1 matchup as
                        favorably as you would the matchup with a melee hero.

                        lie in wait in some patch of trees for the Tinker to come
                        along. Since Tinker players tend to get an Ethereal Blade
                        of their own, late-game Tinker can be especially helpless

                        the Tinker is forced to go BKB or Linken's. Either way
                        lane matchups against a Tinker 1v1 are not that unfavorable,
                        just watch for the Lasers right as you go for last-hits.
                        These plays are opportunities for you to dive in with Burrow

                        Puck is probably tied for the hardest on this list to

                      Sven is one of the classic melee heroes that Sand King

                      or risk taking Caustic harassment and Burrow burst damage.
                      You may end up wanting a Eul's/Eblade/Shiva's Guard to
                      mitigate Sven's extreme physical damage later in the game,
                      but hopefully if you get this lane 1v1, or even 1v2 with
                      some weak support, you can likely snowball off the lane
                      while simultaneously denying Sven tons of farm.

                      Dragon Knight is definitely one of the toughest heroes to kill

                      and instant stun to disengage with, but you should always
                      keep in mind that the armor from DK's passive and the damage
                      reduction from his Breathe Fire have NO effect on your magic
                      damage. Early in the game this means the lane is easily a kill
                      lane for the SK, although DK should be able to last hit somewhat
                      safely and harass you back some. Late-game if the DK starts
                      to really tank up with a Pipe or BKB things can get rocky,
                      but hopefully if you end up in this 1v1 you won't let him
                      get that far along, or you'll punish him by running down
                      his charges and keeping up the pace by pushing out waves
                      and teamfighting constantly with the Octarine build.

                      This has got to be one of the very easiest lanes for
                      Sand King to CS in and kill, but Slardar does have
                      plenty of counterplay potential of his own making this
                      nowhere near the safest 1v1 matchup. Slardar's Crush
                      means he can stun you out of Sand Storm (plus see you
                      during it with his ultimate), and Sprint lets him
                      chase YOU down if you choose to run (if you have Blink
                      and he doesn't you'll get away, but if you both do
                      Slardar can pretty much always catch you, which is rare
                      for Sand King). Either way, the bonus damage Slardar
                      takes from Sprint does mean that he's an easy enough
                      hero to burst down later on in the game, just be aware
                      of any BKB or Pipe of Insight pickups that would throw

                      Alchemist definitely seems like a an underutilized hero
                      these days, but 1v1 against a Sand King he will just look
                      silly. Picking up a couple Mangos, as prescribed here, to
                      counteract the tick damage from Acid Spray is the only real
                      adjustment you'll need to make against Alchemist, though as

                      crippled (temporarily). Later on in the game Alchemist
                      can become quite tanky and hard to burst down, not to mention

                      but this give you all the more reason to go for either
                      control in the form of a Scythe of Vyse to catch out a tanky
                      Alchemist, or more burst damage in the form of Dagon/Eblade to

                      PA is a bit harder than most to shut down completely since
                      she can potentially Blink herself away and keep CSing
                      with her long-range Dagger, BUT she's definitely squishy
                      and slow enough to kill 1v1. A Sand King pick would surely
                      be enough to force PA into an early BKB, but if not you can
                      literally just keep solo-killing her over and over with
                      Epicenter (although do be mindful of baits if you're playing

                      Ursa is a fun hero to kite around with Caustic and Sand Storm,
                      moreso than just about any other. Controlling this big

                      a BKB or Linken's Sphere, so just always keep an eye on his
                      items to anticipate what he's got coming out, and always
                      be the one doing the Blinking onto him, rather than the other
                      way around. You can still escape if he does jump you,
                      but eventually a good Ursa player will itemize Abyssal or
                      Sheepstick to catch you or their other target out (same

                      Despite the fact that this lane is winnable for the

                      that he can Time Walk out of any harass damage you
                      do, which will nearly always be in a tight burst
                      that he can neatly walk off. Later on he can potentially
                      catch you with Chronosphere as you go in for Burrow,

                      This big bad wolf can't do much to you besides nip at you

                      of CS you should be getting in this 1v1 you can almost certainly
                      get an early enough Blink to make your first Epicenter count
                      and start finding pickoffs, but Lycan himself may not
                      be the best target as he's quite tanky, and once he starts

                      be tanky enough to survive Epicenter if you catch

                      him down thanks to Omnislash, so let's not find out
                      unless you're absolutely sure (a silence like Skywrath
                      on your team would help). 1v1 you can bully him out of
                      lane, and he'll have a hard time denying your CS without
                      taking heavy Caustic damage, but ultimately you will
                      take over this lane, just be careful.

                      All of these heroes improve SK's ability to function in
                      teamfights especially, although some do make good lane
                      partners. Consider picking these heroes generically
                      early as a setup for some nuker, and combine SK with
                      one or two meta picks.

                      While the obvious synergy here is simply Repel to allow
                      Sand King to skip BKB himself, the same could be said about
                      literally any other core hero that's item slot limitted.
                      In this case Omni makes a great partner for Sand King because
                      he always puts his body into the middle of the fight, and
                      tossing out that Purify onto a Burrow and/or Epicenter
                      is often all you need to take down a tanky opponent as the
                      Sand King. Finding a laning situation to make use of this
                      combo is definitely a challenge, but the best is actually
                      just a dual offlane against some melee carry and weaker
                      support, for example Spectre/Dazzle or Sven/Lion. 2v2,
                      SK and Omni are nearly as deadly of a duo as Omni and Tusk.

                      Elder Titan is seeing something of a resurgance this patch,

                      the strongest tool of its kind for nuking down clumps of enemies,
                      and you can imagine how strong the wombo from a lineup
                      with 2-3 of these heroes to buff up SK can be. The Elder
                      Titan Echo Stomp into Burrow+Epicenter is much easier to
                      pull off than Titan's own Earth Splitter combo, and is rivaled
                      only by Naga Siren for its ability to set up a perfect Epi.

                      As a teammate, Ancient Apparition is one of the best
                      magic damage amplification heroes there is. His ultimate
                      lets you instagib crowds of enemies, with enough coordination,
                      while Ice Vortex is the perfect accompaniment for your
                      casual Blink+Burrow amplification needs. Best of all,
                      now that Cold Feet has received several direct buffs in a
                      row you can now reasonably max it first while laning with
                      a partner like Sand King, as you can spam it and zone
                      your enemies with the threat of a followup Burrow once
                      the Cold Feet cooldown gets low enough (down to 7s at
                      level 4!). AA is also a great candidate for an early
                      Veil, which is something SK loves from his supports.

                      This is my personal favorite combo with SK, not really because
                      of the mana from Chakra but from the cooldown reduction.
                      Casting Chakra on SK while he's channeling Epicenter allows
                      the SK to perform a near-double Burrowstrike, down to a 5
                      second cooldown or 3 with Octarine. The Octarine+Chakra
                      double Burrow gives Sand King 4.34 seconds of lockdown with a
                      ~1 second gap after the first stun duration ends, before
                      you can cast the second one. Recall and Blinding Light
                      can both also be useful for a KotL to help out his Sand King,
                      to rejoin a push across the map before BoTs or to knock
                      escaping enemies back into your Epicenter.

                      in such situations, your best bet may be to put Sand King solo
                      safelane while offensive tri-laning with the Undying, who can
                      not only make short work of the enemy's three heroes with his
                      Tombstone Zombies, but also later on will amplify up his opponents
                      with his ultimate, Flesh Golem, so that when Sand King eventually
                      rotates for a gank he can deal even more damage.

                      Bloodseeker is perhaps the most underutilized damage buffing hero
                      on this list, and is also one who has great synergy with Sand King.
                      Since you'll like go into Sand Storm or scoot out with a Force Staff
                      after getting off your Epicenter during the fight, Sand King is
                      actually a fairly safe hero to just cast Blood Rage on directly,
                      allowing him to potentially heal up from any creeps or heroes he
                      finishes off with Epicenter and Burrow when he goes in. The real
                      question here is how to lane Bloodseeker and Sand King on the same
                      team—all I have here is theories, but I'd say that putting
                      Bloodseeker either in the jungle or as another core can both work.

                      This is one of the most fun lane combos there is—Snowball
                      into Burrowstrike is a nearly guaranteed catch (blinking
                      heroes can probably escape, or a self-banish like Puck),
                      and the amount of damage these two hefty brawlers put out
                      during the combined stun durations will nearly always result
                      in a kill the first few times you use it. Later on, the potency
                      of this combo falls off because you can't Snowball while
                      channeling Epicenter (it cancels Epi), so you should mostly
                      rely on the lane combination of these two heroes (likely
                      in your offlane) to snowball and win the game.

                      This one is probably less obvious, but Burrowstrike is
                      the perfect duration for Invoker to get a Sun Strike off,
                      allowing your potentially mid Invoker to participate in
                      kills in his own safe or off-lane starting pretty early on.
                      Later on, the potential of a long-range Tornado catch into
                      Epicenter blink combo is really devestating in sloppy
                      jungle fights and skirmishes, making this a scrappy combo
                      of heroes apt for early game rotations. Even as a support
                      SK can make this combo work pretty effectively.

                      Simple enough—Burrow into Arrow makes a pretty good hit and run
                      ganking combination, and once Mirana gets her ultimate you'll be
                      able to gank as a team, or just as a duo, very effectively.
                      The laning possiblities between these two heroes are so
                      open that you can also safely pick them together early,
                      so long as you're able to flip them both to a support
                      if needed.

                      This craggy guy makes an excellent teammate because
                      of his ability to toss you in for a Burrow stun, but it
                      is rather hard to fit both Tiny and Sand King on the
                      same team. Some teams have experimented with some
                      weird offlane or support Tinys, but really I think
                      the best way to make these heroes work together is
                      something like a mid Tiny+IO, or a safelane Tiny.
                      Keep in mind once again though that Tossing your
                      teammate Sand King will cancel Epicenter channeling,
                      so wait until he's done if you want to try for that.

                      Besides the more obvious synergy of Skywrath's
                      Ancient Seal into Burrow/Epi to buff your magical
                      damage—you'll also find that Concussive Shot makes
                      a great setup slow for Sand King to catch out enemies
                      at low levels, especially at level 1 when roaming
                      into your enemy's jungle as 5. Once Skywrath hits level
                      6, the ability to drop Mystic Flare on top of a casual
                      Blink+Burrow turns this ganking duo into a seriously
                      scary one-two punch.

                      Again the first thing to note here is that Relocating
                      while Sand King is channeling Epicenter will result in a
                      canceled ult, BUT the ability to Relocate stun anyone
                      on the map, plus all the bonus movement speed and damage
                      reduction from Tether to help keep Sand King alive, makes
                      this combo a fairly potent one well into the mid-game. The
                      best part about it is that you don't need to lane them
                      together, and can utilize Sand King's naturally strong laning
                      capabilities to afford IO's lane support to a more important
                      hero like your team's hard carry.

                    Of all the combinations with Sand King and his Epicenter,
                    wombo combo is often the most obvious. Keep in mind that
                    putting all your team's eggs in one basket by relying on
                    a large number of long-cooldown ultimates is risky.
                    Losing one teamfight can mean a long period of crippled
                    engagements while waiting for cooldowns to come back up.

                    Miss someone with your Burrow? Catch them before they scurry

                    with ANY teamfight ultimate, and Sand King is no exception.
                    The ability to clean up enemies with huge Epicenters, plus
                    elevate a simple Burrow into a ravage on the whole other team,
                    makes this simple synergy invaluable. You can also make
                    use of Surge plus Ion Shell onto Sand King in lane, which is
                    often something your enemies won't expect but which can happen
                    with either a smoke rotation or a jungle DS/SK.

                    the enemies will be stationary as you line up the perfect
                    Burrowstrike to chain after the Ravage. Offlane Tidehunter
                    and safelane SK is a fairly flat combo that can be punished
                    if you reveal it too early in the draft, so try to hide at
                    least one of these picks until 5th (as with most of the

                    Enigma is a significantly faster jungler than Sand King,
                    plus he's the perfect hero to grab an early Mek instead
                    of a Blink, allowing your team to push and group up earlier
                    and allowing SK to do the initiating. While this combo is
                    somewhat punishable in the draft, you may be able to actually
                    throw your opponent off by picking these two ambiguous heroes
                    early and laning them in a unique configuration, or if your
                    enemy overreacts and plays a style they're not comfortable
                    with. Opponents will definitely be scared if they see Enigma
                    and SK early during the draft, so you should at least be
                    aware of this before you grab them together.

                    A long-range AoE initiator like Warlock is the perfect setup
                    for your majesty's carefully crafted Epicenter. Warlock is
                    viable as a support these days and can certainly zone out an
                    enemy if your core SK gets an unfavorable lane matchup, but
                    even as a core Warlock makes a good companion for Sand King.
                    The utter devestation of Fatal Bonds into Epicenter is enough

                    here is that Magnus's initiation is generally much less

                    As teammates, SK and Faceless really make a powerful duo—Epicenter
                    can deal its damage even if you blink into the Chronosphere,
                    allowing you to potentially followup with a Burrow stun while
                    your enemies are Time Dilated. Other than Zeus and Skywrath there
                    are few magic damage dealers that pair as well with Void as SK
                    does, although having them both on the same team implies that one
                    of them will most likely be safelane. If you can run a support
                    Sand King that also works especially well here, as the new FV
                    really enjoys finding his farm early and may need to rotate around
                    to find a decent lane. SK has the same finicky needs as a core and
                    so may not make the most reliable partner to grab early in a draft.

                    Phoenix is a fun combo to run with Sand King, but their synergy
                    is a bit difficult to take advantage of. The most common play
                    by far will be Sand King blinking in to Burrow stun an enemy that's
                    trying to take down the Supernova, but more effectively you would
                    combine SK and Phoenix with someone like a Treant to ensure that
                    the Phoenix ult goes off first, then put the Epicenter damage
                    on top of the the Supernova stun to let SK do the cleanup. A
                    support Phoenix or even an offlane one with a mid or safelane
                    SK can really result in powerful earlygame teamfights for you,
                    assuming that your lanes go as you would hope. If they don't,
                    that's where some strong support picks come in, to reassure these
                    more utilitarian cores don't falter against a snowballing enemy
                    team with potential hard-er carries.

                    you set the enemy hero down! Don't throw them out of Burrow
                    or Epi. Picking the Rubick as a team looking to grab SK also
                    serves the additional purpose of taking one of his counters
                    off the table.

                    While much less straightforward to execute than the other
                    lane combos mentioned in this section, this is a classic
                    one that works best when the Sand King is the one initiating.
                    As either a support roamer or just a lane partner doing some
                    sneaking around, try popping out from behind some trees as
                    SK and Burrow stunning your lane opponents, allowing Lina
                    the time to follow up with her LSA. The extreme amount of
                    magic burst betweeen these two should be able to level all
                    but the absolute tankiest opponents (BKBs can be a problem
                    too obviously). Picking this much magic damage, especially
                    early on in the draft, can leave your team open to being
                    countered, so be prepared to be creative with your laning
                    to salvage your early game if you do.

                    Sven's Storm Hammer is simply one of the best stuns to follow
                    up on. Not only is it easy to hit, but it does enough damage
                    to soften weaker enemies up for a potential Caustic Finale,
                    maybe adding enough damage to turn a difficult gank into an easy
                    one. Sven's Cleave allows him to make short work of Burrow-stunned
                    targets later on, so consider pairing the two with another
                    synergistic hero like Dark Seer to really emphasize your combo's
                    strength at all stages in the game.

                    The slow from Frost Blast is easily enough to catch a fleeing enemy
                    during the early game, usually, but if not there's always the
                    fact that you're probably destroying the enemy on experience
                    with a Lich on your team—especially if he's in your lane as an SK.
                    Lich would be a fairly decent candidate to get an early Veil to
                    support his SK as well, although this is certainly not a common
                    pickup by any means.

                    This combo has been proven so potent that I had to add it
                    immediately—Na'vi has shown specifically that offlane SK with
                    Dazzle is a very potent kill-lane, and one that's both safe
                    thanks to the heals and Shallow Grave to keep things from going
                    South too quickly, and which will often be underestimated,
                    leading to a kill. The slow from Poison Touch could be nice,
                    but the Shallow Grave to save your Sand King diving under tower
                    is just too strong to pass up. Toss out that Shadow Wave heal
                    after SK goes diving in to proc caustic on a wave of creeps,
                    and practically anyone will go down (even a 10 armor Terrorblade).

                    This is another easy to execute lane combo—just Fortune's
                    End long enough for your SK to walk up and stun. It's
                    actually a strong enough combo that the two heroes can
                    roam together as supports if they have suitable targets
                    to find, although a simple roaming Oracle on top of
                    your core farming Sand King works too. Taking Oracle
                    out of the pool against your Sand King is always helpful
                    too, as his Fate's Edict can completely turn around
                    an Epicenter gank.

                    When it comes to carries with ranged stuns that can set up
                    for a Burrowstrike, Wraith King is about as good as it gets.
                    His unique flavor isn't particularly helpful to a Sand King,
                    but the chaos caused by his respawning and potentially silly
                    Aghanim's upgrade can make him a formidable teammate for SK
                    as well as a decent lane partner. Jungling your SK and then
                    roaming to the Wraith King's lane can work, as well as
                    farming the SK and having a roaming WK to stun into the lane,
                    probably from Smoke.

                    Venge can use Magic Missile to set up for Burrowstrike.
                    That's about the extent of the synergy, besides swap
                    saving the Sand King or swapping an enemy into Epicenter,
                    but that means that like the other heroes on this list
                    Venge makes a good support (and rarely carry) to pair with
                    Sand King when it comes to Captain's Mode. The lack of
                    any strong synergy means this is a combo you would probably
                    roam them together early and then turn SK into a static
                    jungler or laner, because neither one of these heroes
                    can carry on their own or together, and thus they cannot
                    afford to both be cores on the same team.

                    They make a decent roaming support duo or lane partners,
                    but do keep in mind that their synergy starts to really
                    fall apart after the early-mid game when teamfights start
                    to become messier. It's hard to use Disruption to set up
                    for an Epicenter unless you're getting clean initiations,
                    so potentially save this combo for a late-draft pocket

                    Also useful as a counter to Sand King with his Coco's Rum,
                    Kunkka is a stellar combo hero with Sand King, especially
                    together in a dual- or tri-lane getting kills. X-Marks is
                    an incredible ability to catch opponents out, so a support
                    Kunkka maxing it first can make your team's Sand King's
                    life incredibly easy. X-Marks into Burrow and/or Torrent
                    is already ~4 seconds of disable, and of course that all
                    that Kunkka AoE damage can be used to proc Caustic. Later
                    on in the game, the wombo-combo of a simple Boat plus
                    Torrent onto a Burrow+Epi is enough to win the fight on
                    its own.

                      of regen to make this matchup bearable, but Veno is squishy
                      and slow enough to make your kill potential at levels 5-7
                      decent. Just don't feed before then!

                      Clockwerk is one of the best heroes at catching Sand King
                      out, both with Flare to reveal him in trees plus cancel his
                      Blink Dagger, and also Cogs to knock you out of Sand Storm
                      and burn some mana. Just overall not a fun hero to play against,
                      even if you're capable of out-CSing him 1v1.

                      they're still listed here as counters because you want to avoid

                      Rubick, along with the several other heroes listed below, can
                      on very rare occasions ruin your Epicenter initiaton by snatching
                      you (or in some of the cases below, hexing or silencing you) instantly,
                      before you can even get the Burrowstrike off but after blinking in.
                      These kinds of superhuman feats are actually performed by simple
                      shift-queuing of commands usually, but still you must be wary
                      of these outplay potentials, as well as the potential for Rubick
                      to nab one of your spells. None of them is one you particularly
                      want to give Rubick, but Sand Storm is most definitely the one
                      you're most okay handing over, so always try to use that after
                      your initiations if you don't catch Rubick himself. All of
                      this discussion and we have to of course mention Rubick's aura,
                      which is actually perhaps the number one reason why Rubick sucks
                      to play against as SK. Being that level 1 Null Field was recently
                      buffed to 10% magic resistance, you certainly want to control
                      the Rubick pick after you've grabbed Sand King, if you can.

                      It should be pretty plain to see, but Rage is stupidly
                      good way for a melee carry like Lifestealer to avoid
                      all of your Epicenter damage, and potentially even the
                      Burrow stun if you aren't on point with your shift-queuing.
                      In lane the SK should actually dominate a 1v1 matchup with
                      Lifestealer where CS is concerned, but you'll have far less
                      kill potential than against other melee laners and be in
                      some danger should the Lifestealer get support rotations.
                      A good Lifestealer player won't be afraid to dive you early
                      on, thanks to his Rage.

                      Ember is definitely a slippery split pusher capable of
                      getting caught by your average SK player, BUT thanks to
                      Flame Guard you'll nearly always find the solo-kill much
                      harder than other similar heroes. If Ember for some reason
                      doesn't have the Flame Guard up, and/or you get an aggressive
                      burst item like Dagon, you can definitely pick off the
                      otherwise somewhat fragile Ember Spirit. Sand King does
                      have the choice of picking up a Eul's to dispel his Flame
                      Guard, but this combo may simply fail if the Ember has
                      a remnant up that he can leap out to. Not to mention
                      Ember can also respond to you with Linken's or BKB to
                      try and stop your initiations, or even Skadi to tank
                      through them instead.

                      of being able to escape from most sticky situations if Huskar
                      starts to get Burning Spear stacks on you. Avoid wasting your

                      While a Sand King is quite ideal for hunting down and catching

                      find that Anti-Mage is quite an annoying target to take down.
                      For this reason I still don't recommend this matchup if you
                      can avoid it, even though Sand King can be great at catching
                      out a ratting AM. At the end of the day it comes down to your
                      confidence that the Sand King will snowball off of heroes
                      besides the Anti-Mage. The 1v1 matchup between the two is easy
                      to get last-hits but potentially dangerous due to AM's mana-drain
                      the fact that he has an escape to bait you with, plus Anti-Mage
                      often gets help from his supports.

                      Pudge is just an annoying hero largely, but his innate
                      magic resistance and ability to scale infinitely into a
                      long game where you may be struggling to pump out enough
                      damage is disturbing. As a Sand King, I would really LOVE
                      to avoid playing against Pudges altogether, but the 1v1
                      lane matchup really shouldn't be that bad. Avoid getting
                      hooked out of Sand Storm or caught out by some kind of
                      surprise magic resistance and you'll be fine. Later on,
                      after Pudge has something like a Blink, you'll have to be
                      clever and also control the other team's vision to maintain
                      the advantage in this matchup during chaotic mid-game

                    Dark Seer is annoying for any melee hero to lane against
                    because he'll definitely force you to invest in additional
                    regen or an item like Tranquil Boots, BUT he's also
                    quite simple to catch and kill, and can't do a darned thing
                    to contest your CS without putting himself in danger. For
                    this reason your best bet in this lane is to just grin
                    and bear the Ion Shell harassment, leveling perhaps
                    4-0-3 and taking Epicenter at level 8 once you get Blink
                    so as to maximize your chance to catch the pointy bugger.

                    Mangos, Nyx is not an opponent you really want to lane
                    against. You can certainly CS and potentially kill him if he
                    gets overzealous, but his kit is well-suited to outplays

                    1v1 matchups like the ones listed here. These are the

                    Clinkz is highly frustrating as the Sand King because

                    is a very real and present threat, even 1v1. You
                    do not want to get silenced especially early on in the
                    game before you get up an item like Blink, Force, BKB or

                    Viper is definitely a target you'll struggle to focus down

                    Viper's Corrosive Skin—but there are always moments when
                    you'll be able to catch the immobile Viper out. This is a
                    very difficult 1v1 matchup for any melee hero like SK, and
                    mid-lane especially you'll find it's better suited to a
                    ranged playmaker like Puck.

                    also Necrophos's tendency to tank up, build defensive items
                    like Mek/Pipe, and ability to catch you out with his ult.
                    His ranged harassment and overall lane presence makes him
                    one of the worst heroes to 1v1 mid or in a side-lane.

                    BUT you can always kill them if you somehow catch them. Avoiding
                    the 1v1 matchup here is once again probably a good idea,
                    although some kind of 2v1 shenanigans like Tiny+SK here could be
                    great fun to feed on a glass cannon like Sniper.

                    to potentially ruin Sand Storm if you ever need to go for
                    that play. Basically this matchup should be a cat-and-mouse
                    game to see who takes Sand Storm/Silence first, but you
                    have a much lower chance of coming out on top thanks to

              For free farm lanes where you most likely won't be ganked, and
              won't need to jungle or escape a gank early on, this build provides
              the best combination of lane presence, gank potential and safety.
              Skipping Sand Storm at level 8 and taking Caustic over Burrowstrike
              would provide more damage at levels 5-9, but you're only able to
              utilize that bonus Caustic damage situationally.

                  This is the most aggressive skill build, foregoing early points
                  in Sand Storm to focus on winning the lane, so naturally at
                  level 1 you should abuse your Stout and/or Quelling Blade to
                  to get off Caustic harass on your opponent. If for some reason
                  you're not in a 1v1 lane, keep in mind that you can always
                  do small camps with level 1 Caustic, but this only benefits
                  you if you're in your own safelane of course.

                  Once you have both Burrow and Caustic, you're a kill threat.
                  Generally at level 2 you'll only be able to kill a very inexperienced
                  opponent, but with support gank rotations you can possibly pick
                  off your lane opponent (a hero like Witch Doctor, Skywrath, etc
                  makes a good gank partner, someone with damage and CC). At this
                  point you should only use Burrow for damage on your opponent,
                  not to farm, unless of course you're mid and looking to push
                  the wave before going for a rune. Your damage spike at level
                  3 means you'll want to save your mana for then.

                  (if you look at the chart above carefully, you'll see that Caustic
                  provides more absolute damage since you can proc it on a whole creep

                  Level 5 is one of your peaks against your lane partner, as you'll
                  find that it's a common time for you to get a kill in a lane that
                  you've been slowly taking over. By this point you can clear a
                  creep wave and most medium jungle camps with Burrow and one or two
                  Caustic procs. If you can get this off on your opponent once or twice,

                  Not every build here recommends Epicenter at level 6, and that's
                  because without a Blink Dagger you'll always have a hard time using
                  it. The best way to use an Epicenter without Blink is NOT to clear
                  stacks, no no you must set a trap. Hide in trees (use that Quelling
                  Blade!), wait for someone squishy to walk by (you deal ~600 damage
                  plus any Caustic procs you can find, after reductions), then Epi
                  in the trees and Burrow out onto them. This move only works in
                  the early game before people have mobility or defensive items, so
                  take advantage if you can. The combined slows from Caustic and Epi
                  can make even a fast hero significantly slowed as they escape, just
                  avoid using this combo on a Blink hero like Anti-Mage or QoP unless
                  you brought some stun-lock.

                  With max Burrow you can safely roam looking for pick-offs, but
                  more likely you'll be getting close to Blink Dagger money at this
                  point, and if so you'll want to find an empty lane and farm away.
                  Obviously if you had points in Sand Storm you could alternatively
                  jungle, but keep in mind that this point of this particular build
                  is to be in a lane, getting all the last hits and zoning out any
                  enemies who are dumb enough to stand near you. You're the KING
                  of this lane, so make sure that all other 9 players know it.

                  What's this? A point in SAND STORM? Why would we want that? Well
                  if you haven't deviated from this lunatic guide yet then I might
                  as well give you an explanation: it's to escape. At this point,
                  level 8, you should almost certainly be getting your Blink, and
                  now is the moment when you'll need Sand Storm not as a jungling
                  tool but as an escape. After you Blink deep into the enemy team
                  a time or two without Sand Storm, you'll stop going 4-0-4-1 or
                  whatever it was Moo did one DC game recently. The extra damage
                  from Caustic is amazing, and costs no mana, but you do need
                  Sand Storm by around the time you have Blink.

                  More Caustic means both faster jungling and more kill potential,
                  so snap it up. Lane creeps are easy to blow up with one Burrow
                  at this point, but the magic resistance and higher health pools
                  of jungle creeps means it's way more efficient to utilize just
                  W and E when jungling, if you decide to. With one point in Sand
                  Storm you can certainly do any camp or stack you want to, but
                  you'll have to stand there and take some damage while you apply
                  Caustic if you want to do any stacked jungle camps.

                  safelane or mid, and showing up at fights is the first step

                  With max Sand Storm and Octarine you can use that sucker to disjoint

                  mean you also have the ability to jungle slightly earlier. Especially
                  as a mid-lane Sand King this can pay off if you're able to burst
                  down creep waves and then go stack for yourself, or have a support

                  In the offlane or midlane you may find yourself getting ganked
                  even as early as level 1. Usually if you're 1v1 in the safelane
                  you can use your map awareness to detect any enemy rotations
                  coming your way, but in the midlane and offlane specifically
                  you're much more likely to be within range of an enemy support
                  rotation pre-level 4. Taking Sand Storm as early as level 2
                  will likely work out fine if you absolutely have to do it, but
                  your kill potential compared to the Lane King build is drastically
                  reduced if you are forced to compromise like this. With adequate
                  Observer Wards and missing calls you should be able to just back
                  off any time an enemy support goes missing (assuming they could kill
                  you of course), allowing you to safely just take Sand Storm a little
                  later such as at level 4.

                  When it comes to burst damage at level 3, 1-0-2 is definitely the

                  and works in practically any situation. Just keep in mind that
                  the extremely long cooldown of level 1 Sand Storm means that
                  a smart opponent will make you waste it before the actual gank
                  shows up, so you actually stand more to lose by taking Sand Storm
                  and wasting it than by simply holding a skill point until you
                  absolutely need it or simply investing in more harassment/farming

                  With 1-1-2 you become a somewhat reliable ganker and jungler

                  you're in the offlane and not enjoying yourself you can leave!

                  convenient new sidelane creep camp if you aren't getting much

                  At this point you want to return to your regularly scheduled
                  programming by maxing Burrowstrike. Level 5 with 2-1-2 is
                  nowhere near as strong as 3-0-2 or 2-0-3, but you'll find
                  that you can likely still harass your opponent out of lane
                  with a couple Burrow+Caustic combos. Especially if you're
                  offlaning against the enemy's hard carry, don't be afraid
                  to dump your remaining regen into some dangerous dives just
                  to disrupt their farm at this point, especially if you aren't
                  being bothered by the enemy supports enough to feel like you

                  Why would you want to skip Epicenter at level 6? Well, most of
                  the time it's because you aren't going to be able to kill anyone
                  with it anyway. As a rather long cooldown ultimate, however, the
                  usual school of thought is that you want to use it as many times
                  as you can throughout the game, so it's really up to you to decide
                  if a level 6 gank with Epicenter but no Blink is going to work.
                  If you do opt to skip it here, you're essentially committing to
                  staying in lane until you finish Blink and get level 8.

                <p>
                  The main reason to max Burrowstrike is that you really want
                  that maximum cast range, but the damage is nice too. With
                  4-1-2-0 at level 7 you offer close to the maximum burst damage
                  possible without using Epicenter, plus with your Sand Storm you
                  actually have a way to survive any gank you go for, but in general
                  this build is about static laning and flash-farming with some
                  degree of safety. If you somehow end up getting Blink at level 7,
                  before you get a skill point for Epicenter, you can still rotate
                  around looking for ganks, but it also may be worth considering
                  using your Level 1 Sand Storm and Caustic to jungle up one more
                  level quietly so as to not reveal your Blink before you have Epi.

                  It's pretty much always a good idea to pick up a Smoke of Deceit
                  to send out on the courier with your Blink Dagger. Your first rotation
                  is definitely the most important moment of the game for a Sand King,
                  as it will set the tempo for your farming for the next 10 minutes
                  and gives you an idea of what kind of itemization you want to go for.
                  If you find that the first gank fails because your opponents are tanky,
                  you may want to go straight into a Veil or Dagon. If you die because
                  of enemy support rotations, you may want a Force Staff or Eul's next.
                  If you succeed in killing 1 or 2 major targets and everything goes
                  according to plan, Boots of Travel are the next purchase because they
                  allow you to keep the pressure up AND find farm all over the map.

                  After your first rotation you might even already have reached
                  level 9 if you were successful, but either way you now most likely
                  want to return to the lane you came from and keep farming. If you
                  see easy pickoffs across the map or both teams are doing lots
                  of fighting you likely want to be there instead, but as a Core Sand
                  King keeping up your farm is what sets you apart from a support,
                  and you'll farm considerably faster in lane than in the jungle.
                  Just make sure to keep a vigilant eye on the mini-map at this point,
                  as the fact that your lanes will have most likely collapsed means
                  that supports and gankers will be roaming potentially anywhere and
                  everywhere looking for opportunities to kill oblivious heroes

                  With level 2 Epicenter and maxed Caustic by level 11, this build
                  completely maximizes your damage potential at this point. Level 11
                  is an excellent timing for your first few aggressive pushes as a
                  team, taking perhaps any tier 1/2 towers that might be in your way
                  and Roshan. One good tip here in general is that Sand King is even
                  better at counter-initiating than initiating, so when you're playing
                  around an objective you can almost always afford to hang back, possibly
                  in the trees, looking for the perfect moment to strike. Be patient
                  with your first few Epicenters and you will be rewarded with an
                  unstoppable snowball.

                  The second point of Sand Storm and on are not really going to be
                  used for farming the jungle at this point so much as to allow you
                  to escape during teamfights and deal slightly more damage if you
                  get the chance to Sand Storm on top of your Epi. Ultimately the
                  damage from Sand Storm is slightly easier to get off in a teamfight
                  than that of Caustic, but you're much more likely to be able to
                  tap some creeps and casually catch enemy heroes with Caustic damage
                  in early game teamfights, which tend to be less chaotic and easier
                  to escape.

            <h4>Farm that Jungle</h4>
            <p>
              For games when you plan to dedicated jungle levels 1-4. This build is
              specifically for passive early games, which are usually bad for your
              team, so be sure to mentally check that your team can handle this greedy
              support play. Once again delay Epicenter until you get Blink Dagger—unless
              you think you can successfully gank someone pre-blink.

                  This is absolutely one of the trickiest parts of this guide, and if
                  I get around to it I'll add a video of it, but you CAN jungle at level
                  1 with Caustic Finale. If you're not going to go practice it in an
                  empty lobby before you unleash this on the public, just stop right
                  here and go find another Sand King jungle guide. You can also do the
                  the same movements with Sand Storm, but the 40s cooldown at level 1
                  does mean that you'll be slightly slower in getting your level 2.
                  Basically you need to start off by doing your side's small camp twice,
                  using Tangos to heal up constantly, and if at all possible you want to
                  stack the nearest camp at 0:53. You may think that sounds impossible,
                  but if you cut down a bunch of trees between the small camp and the
                  nearby medium camp to the Northwest for Radiant, or the nearby large
                  camp to the Southwest for Dire using your Iron Talon you'll find it's
                  quite reliable. Assuming no one saps any exp, finishing the second
                  small camp will give you level 2 and Sand Storm to then clear your
                  first stack. Just be aware that on Dire side, this puts you quite
                  close to any action happening top lane, so you may want to have your
                  team's other support nearby on the off chance you need to zone out
                  the enemy offlaner.

                  Alright if you're still following along, clear your first medium camp
                  stack with level 1 Sand Storm and potentially some Caustic procs. At
                  this point if you had Burrow you'd want to gank, but since you have
                  Caustic we get to do something way more fun: DOUBLE STACK! This is really
                  tricky again, so please practice it before trying in a live game, but
                  essentially you want the 6 second timer for Caustic to expire right
                  at the stack timer for one camp, while in the meantime you walk over
                  and manually stack another camp. To do this you have to first aggro
                  (but not ATTACK) the correct camp at ~:45 seconds (either the
                  Southernmost Dire medium camp, the one closest to the top rune, or
                  the Radiant medium camp closest to the mid-lane), then turn to
                  sting (apply Caustic to) one of the creeps at :49, and finally
                  use Iron Talon or simply aggro the nearest camp at :55 (the Radiant
                  large camp or the Dire medium camp up the stairs from you). Note
                  that connecting with the double stack on radiant is also much easier
                  if you cut some trees. If all of this sounds way too difficult,
                  just jungle with Sand Storm and Caustic as you would normally, but
                  be as efficient with your Caustic procs and Iron Talon as you can!
                  The best strategy is usually to apply Caustic to any of the small
                  creeps in a camp (usually more if it's a stack), then use Talon
                  on the highest health creep, and finally Sand Storm near the edge of
                  the spawn box that the creeps will run towards.

                  Since we're jungling full-time here you want to get another point in
                  Sand Storm right away, which conveniently you should be able to get
                  after finishing your first medium camp stack. Level 2 Sand Storm means
                  you have a 30s cooldown and can thus clear two non-stacked camps per
                  minute (and you CAN clear stacked camps that fast if you get lucky
                  and get small Satyrs or Wolves), which is as much as you need to happily
                  Sand Storm away in the jungle. If you clear two camps with Sand Storm
                  plus the small camp with Caustic per minute you should be able to have
                  those Tranquils and your Blink by around 9 minutes.

                  When to gank, as a jungle Sand King? Not with level 1 Burrow. This
                  is a build where you want to use Burrow pretty much only defensively
                  or to clear a camp that's about to kill you, otherwise you aren't
                  going to be doing much rotating. Your goal is to lay low and get

                  Higher levels of Burrowstrike can actually clear some camps with
                  just Caustic Finale, for example small Satyrs and Wolves. If you
                  really need to make a stack timing or clear the camp before the
                  minute mark comes up and you block it accidentally, this is around
                  the point where you can do that.

                  always do a little calculation in your head: after reductions, you
                  deal ~500 damage from a full Epicenter, ~215 from Burrow, ~35 per
                  passive Caustic proc and ~70 when a creep dies, and of course
                  around ~40 damage per second from Sand Storm. You should expect
                  to be able to kill any non-mobile target without magic immunity

                  It's pretty normal for Sand King to return to the jungle after
                  executing his first Epicenter gank combo, but the game state at
                  this point can vary so much that it's hard to give you much direction
                  besides keep farming when you can. If your team's objective is to
                  push early and avoid taking the game late you can certainly begin
                  to deathball with them and build some support items to keep the push
                  alive, but if you get the chance to go back into the jungle and
                  farm greedily there are all kinds of strategies you can come up with.
                  Ultimate you want to keep leveling Caustic at this point to take
                  advantage of the burst damage in the early game while it still matters,
                  not to mention speed up any farming you're able to do.

                  At this point you're nearing your peak power and hopefully your team
                  has utilized your early Blink to get multiple pickoffs on key targets
                  or win any teamfights. Go for kills on enemies surrounded by creeps
                  to proc Caustic as many times as possible, but otherwise you can pretty
                  much afford to just play with your team and grab any farm you see in
                  the jungle or open lanes. Just remember that as a support SK you're not
                  trying to take up space but create it, so if your team is fighting you

                  Level 11 is a huge power peak for Sand King, although with this skill

                  means you can deal around 1000 damage pretty easily if there are nearby

                  With maxed Caustic you will most likely be able to farm faster

                  farm. One Caustic sting plus a Burrow can clear a whole creep
                  wave, and gives you a whopping ~900 damage if you apply Caustic
                  to a whole wave and then Burrowstrike to clear it!

              and potentially risky play-style, so it works best against slow/immobile
              heroes and weak supports. For a more defensive/standard version of this

                  There's no way you're going to get work done at level 1 without
                  using your stun, plain and simple. While level 1 Burrowstrike is
                  considerably less mana-hungry at just 110 manacost, you'll be
                  hard-pressed to cast the spell more than twice without some kind
                  of mana regeneration item. In case you haven't done the math, that
                  means that you need to connect with a kill on one of those two
                  Burrows, or else you're looking at the walk of shame to fountain
                  and back. You need to reach Arcane boots ASAP, and like most other
                  roaming heroes, the way to do that is by not dying and saving your
                  900 gold up over ~3-4 minutes. Go to lane with your offlaner if
                  you have the ability to soak some experience there without getting
                  killed, and grab level 2 that way if at all possible. Your other
                  possible move at level 1 is to try and get behind the enemy mid or
                  offlaner with a smoke or just some creative rotating. You may want
                  to wait for level 2 and Caustic to do this though, as the chances of
                  killing with your first Burrow are much higher if you have the burst
                  damage from level 1 Caustic.

                  This skill build definitely doesn't look like most support SK
                  builds, but the essence of taking Caustic this early is that it's
                  perfect for harassment, almost like a super Orb of Venom. Besides
                  the ability to chase down most slower heroes in an open chase, Caustic
                  on a support SK allows you to zone out opponents by simply applying
                  Caustic to the creeps in their lane. This kind of zoning manuever
                  obviously pushes the lane in, so use sparingly and at intelligent
                  moments, e.g. like right before a rune spawns so that you can force
                  your opponent to stay in lane to get exp, or when the lane is near
                  your enemy's tower so that you can potentially hurt the enemy laner's
                  farm by forcing them to last-hit under tower. Also, note that since
                  you won't be getting more levels of Caustic anytime soon, you might
                  want to learn exactly how much damage you can deal with Caustic this

                  Unless for some reason you end up needing to start jungling at
                  this point (in which case take Sand Storm), your goal at this
                  point is to keep looking for any ganks you can, whether against
                  your offlaner's lane partner or against the enemy mid. Generally
                  you just want to figure out the weakest enemy lane and feed off of
                  that for at least a kill or two, although you may quickly end up
                  backing off to the jungle if any of your early gank attempts fail
                  or if you end up farming the offlane after your offlaner dies or
                  falls back to jungle himself. You'll definitely take Sand Storm
                  at level 4 if not by now, so consider looking for opportunities
                  to stack jungle camps (at :53 or :55) in between looking for
                  kills and rotating around the map. You can even potentially
                  control runes with this build, using a Bottle and your early
                  points in stun to fight anyone who shows up to contest you.

                  By this point you will need to start supplementing any lane farm
                  and exp from kills you're finding with jungle farm to stay ahead
                  (unless you've taken over one of the lanes and started grabbing
                  solo exp, but this depends on your ally being able to jungle so
                  don't count on it). Sand Storm level 1 still has an obnoxiously
                  long cooldown, but with the new longer duration you can actually
                  clear single stacked jungle camps despite the recently added
                  stacking magic resistance on certain creeps.

                  At this point in your build you're actually quite strong relative

                  If you're never going to be able to sneak up on your enemies and

                  that Blink Dagger) very fast at all. You may decide to take a second
                  early point in Sand Storm if you find that you aren't successful with
                  enough ganks to get your Blink at a reasonable time, so that you can

                  There's a whole art to killing enemies with Epicenter before
                  you get a Blink Dagger. Especially if you're coming from a tough
                  offlane where your opponent expects you to be underleveled
                  and underfarmed, there are all kinds of wonky plays you can
                  make to get a kill here at level 6 and accelerate yourself back
                  to the farm level of a safe or midlane Core hero. Most of the
                  tricks involve a Smoke to position behind your enemy and Quelling
                  Blade to sneak in through some trees, but suffice it to say as
                  long as you're creative your enemy will probably be surprised.
                  Just keep in mind that you stand to deal at most around ~800
                  damage after reductions, and that includes hitting some Caustic
                  procs and Burrow.

                  builds here, meaning that even as a support SK you still reach your
                  full offensive catch potential at level 7. Even without a reasonbly
                  early Blink, the extended cast range of Burrow level 4 makes you
                  as dangerous as you'll ever be as a roamer, so take advantage and
                  keep the pressure on at these levels, especially if you still have

                  Basically you need to be finding kills or getting
                  jungle farm, one or the other. If for some reason you find a lane to
                  farm that's great, but you probably want to be taking more points in
                  Caustic ASAP if that's the situation you find yourself in. Even just
                  the second point in Caustic over Sand Storm or Epicenter can make
                  your lane presence that much more reliable, even as an underleveled
                  support trying to lane against the enemy safelane, for example.
                  Otherwise, just take your second point in Sand Storm early and
                  farm the jungle in between each attempted gank.

                  For a support roaming SK your Blink timing might not be that great,
                  but hopefully level 9 is about the latest you're going to find Blink.
                  If all goes well hopefully you can get it more like level 7 or 8,
                  it just depends on how well your ganks and overall movement go. This
                  type of play requires an intuition for what you can accomplish so
                  that you can figure out which rotations will work, but practice makes
                  perfect! Hitting those stack timings and clearing camps in time to
                  make it to rune spawns is definitely something you learn from
                  experience (watching pros can really help here too).

                  More levels in Caustic helps with your farming no matter where you
                  are, plus it increases your burst damage. At this point it's also
                  highly likely that you'll have a lane to farm as the lanes start
                  to break down and each team's core heroes start to rotate
                  and group up, so make sure you hold on to a TP scroll or two
                  and actually show up to fights. If you're playing support SK,
                  showing up to fights is of the utmost importance, although if you
                  don't have a Blink Dagger it's often excusable to stay in lane
                  farming if your teammates are somehow keeping the enemy busy
                  elsewhere on the map. Just don't be oblivious and get killed
                  because you got distracted by farming!

                  Depending on whether or not you took a second point in Sand
                  Storm earlier, either level 11 or 12 will be your peak damage
                  potential relative to most heroes, as you dish out a tremendous
                  amount of AoE damage in teamfights. Hopefully by around level
                  11 you've also reached your second major item, usually something
                  like a Force Staff on a support SK. The utility of a second
                  mobility item on SK, or even the damage from a teamfighting item
                  like Veil, should allow you to scale extremely well into the
                  early-mid-game, teamfighting with your allies and farming up a
                  storm in between. Make sure to keep up your end of the warding
                  duties as a support SK, especially because with your Blink you
                  stand to be able to rotate and gank anyone you spot out alone.
                  This means that creative warding, especially lane wards on the
                  enemy side of the map or overlooking some of their jungle camps,
                  are the best to get you kills.

                  Max out that passive and now you've got the full payload online.
                  You don't need to be doing much lane farming at this point, but
                  again you're excellent at soaking it up if there is any available.
                  Don't be a farm hog just because this guide lists tons of items—your
                  team's core players hopefully scale harder than you do, so for example
                  if you're looking at this guide you can safely ignore most of the
                  normal item timings and simply get whatever you can as far items.
                  Major items like Octarine and Aghanim's are still incredibly strong
                  on a support SK, but if you end up skipping them entirely and just
                  piecing together 3-4 small items like Eul's/Force/Veil, that's entirely
                  acceptable.

                        Most SK players seem to go for a Stout Shield in 1v1 matchups,
                        and understandably so. Stout is always a good pickup when you'll
                        be taking harass or tanking creeps while going for harass, so
                        even as a non-starting item Stout can be invaluable to SK. With
                        the aggressive nature of his lane presence, however, Quelling Blade
                        makes a nearly adequate substitute in terms of how much aggression
                        and lane control it allows. You'll burn through your regen quicker
                        with a QB, but with Stout you'll be able to maybe get that level 3
                        or 4 before having to back in the offlane, giving you the point in
                        Sand Storm you need to jungle, for instance.

                        Quelling Blade is exponentially better on Sand King than most
                        heroes, even other melee heroes, because of the nature of Caustic
                        Finale. Quelling Blade's 40% bonus damage, plus Caustic level 1's
                        90 magical damage, means you have two means of getting last-hits,
                        both much higher than the average hero's level 1 damage. Keep in
                        mind that you must still last-hit the creep at the ~75 damage
                        threshhold unless the 6 second Caustic timer from one of your
                        stings expires at the right time, dealing 45 damage, or you can
                        last-hit another nearby creep to cause the full 90 damage. Quelling
                        Blade means you have a much wider window (~20 damage at level 1)
                        to weave in close to the creeps for a last hit. This means
                        you spend ~40% less time in danger of getting harassed, if
                        you're still following along with my pseudo-math.

                        Iron Talon has changed the face of Dota forever, allowing
                        all kinds of new heroes to jungle more effectively. For heroes
                        that were right on the borderline of being good-to-decent
                        junglers before Iron Talon, like Sand King, it makes him
                        a pretty darned reliable one. This build never advocates
                        Sand Storm at level 1 (full-time jungling is a whole different
                        guide), so since you'll be jungling starting with Caustic Finale
                        you'll want an Iron Talon to help you cut through those
                        first few big creeps you Sand Storm down with your puny level
                        1 Sand Storm damage. Don't forget to put Caustic on at least
                        a small creep or two in any stacks you take (heal the damage
                        you take with a Tango or Tranquils).

                        If you're doing anything besides jungling at level 1 as a
                        support Sand King, you need boots. Wind Lace is sometimes
                        acceptable if you for some reason don't have 400 gold to
                        spend, but that already suggests to me that you're trying
                        to play him as a 5-position, which is pretty rough. Grab a
                        ward and potentially head to the lane with your offlaner
                        if you're in a lower-level pub, using Boots+Caustic to harass
                        and your ward to keep track of rotations. If you feel
                        confident enough to rotate middle or safelane with a smoke
                        of deceit (confident that you'll get a kill without dying
                        yourself!), then that's where these boots really come in.
                        Without boots of speed, there's practically no way you're
                        going to catch someone with a level 1 Burrowstrike!

                        jungle camps, you'll want to move on to Tranquil Boots

                  This guide is geared towards core Sand King play, but it's
                  definitely possible to utilize Caustic Finale as a support
                  SK. If I ever add a video to this guide, it will definitely
                  include a section on how to double stack with Caustic Finale.
                  The essence of this build is that you can clear small camps,
                  and some medium camps like small Satyrs, with even just one
                  level of CF, and if you time it right also stack one,
                  possibly two camps in the jungle for you to clear later.
                  Keep in mind that Centaurs and Ursa camps have the
                  magic resist aura, making any stacks with these creeps
                  considerably more difficult to take from 6.86 on.

                        As self-explanatory as boots are on pretty much every hero,
                        Sand King has an especially strong dependence on movement
                        speed, which is definitely reflected in his boots choice.
                        Getting these up ASAP as a mid or safelane core SK often
                        means the difference between surviving a gank, as well as
                        in catching your opponent with Burrow. Even if you plan
                        to go for early regen items like Soul Ring, Urn or Wand,
                        you need to get boots first! The only exception to this is
                        Bottle when you're mid-laning, which is just too important
                        for rune control to delay.

                        Bottle is the staple of any hero that wants to go mid,
                        but it even functions reasonably well on jungle and
                        offlane heroes thanks to the possibility of rotating
                        for runes. When you go mid especially you want to rush
                        the item ASAP to start pushing your advantage in the
                        lane, which on Sand King means using Burrow just to
                        CS and harass. Don't let mana go to waste when you
                        take those sips! Bottle is definitely a go-to regen
                        item on practically any roaming hero, and the
                        nice thing about it on SK is that it doesn't set you
                        as far off of your core progression as Tranquil/Soul
                        Ring does, assuming that the health regen from Bottle
                        is sufficient and you can proceed to Arcane/Blink.
                        Some games the early Tranquils on roaming SK are just
                        too valuable though, and in those games Bottle +
                        Tranquils is pretty decent as well.

                        After being changed for several patches, the cooldown on
                        these shiny blue boots is now holding steady at
                        55 seconds, meaning you get an effective bonus 2.45
                        (135/55) mana per second. That 135 mana will be enough
                        for you to have a free Burrow once every minute-ish, which
                        combos nicely with two Mangos you maybe have/had.
                        Basically all this extra mana in lane makes you even more of
                        a menace to lane 1v1 against, gives you better odds of
                        escaping if you get ganked, AND it means any allies that
                        hang around you get to benefit as well. If you end up grouping
                        and pushing any time before 20 minutes, the effect of the
                        mana restoration on all of your allies can be pretty darned
                        good on its own, but the #1 greatest trick with Arcane Boots
                        on Sand King is that you'll be able to disassemble them into
                        your early Boots of Travel and Soul Booster.

                        These boots are AMAZING for a hero who needs movement speed
                        as badly as SK, and they're the golden standard item for him
                        in the jungle. No matter what the situation they allow you to
                        stay healthy and get around way faster, but while roaming
                        especially you need to consider the opportunity cost of
                        spending any gold you don't absolutely HAVE to. Saving the
                        majority of your gold by skimping on cheap early game items
                        and simply focusing on consumables like Wards/Smokes/TPs until
                        you save up enough for Blink can make your early roaming pay
                        off that much sooner, especially if your first couple of ganks
                        work out.

                        Soul Ring pretty much always needs to be combined with Tranquil
                        Boots on a hero like Sand King without any built-in sustain.
                        For this reason the timing on this item isn't really as useful
                        as that of Arcane Boots unless you reeeeally need that Tranquil
                        armor and regen to survive a hard lane. You don't have much use
                        for Bloodstone either, unlike other nuker heroes that can justify
                        this item without Tranquils. If you really feel like a Soul Ring
                        would be nice but don't have Tranquils, never hesitate to just
                        grab another Mango!

                        Hopefully you don't need too much convincing about why this
                        item is good on SK, but suffice it to say that a decent Blink
                        Dagger timing is absolutely pivotal to snowballing as a core
                        Sand King. Plenty of higher level players than me have tested
                        out the Aether Lens first build in official matches, and every
                        time they flounder around trying to make their first few ganks
                        work with 850 initiation range instead of the 1850 they would
                        have with Blink. Trust me—that extra 5% damage will never make
                        up for even ONE missed Burrowstrike.

                        Urn is an item you only really want on Sand King if you're a
                        support. The ability to gain charges from successful ganks, which

                        roll into some extra damage for the next gank, is perfect for
                        a roaming SK, plus the bonus mana regen is helpful to avoid
                        going back to base.

                      Boots of travel are a way underbought item on tempo-controlling
                      core heroes like core Sand King, who stands to split farm just
                      as well as other heroes like PL or Ember Spirit who often get
                      early BoTs but also has a strong desire to be at every mid-game
                      teamfight so he can get off Epicenter. Not only does picking up
                      BoTs early save you gold in the long run and help you keep your
                      inventory uncluttered with TP Scrolls, but ultimately BoTs even
                      help your ganking by allowing you to close gaps on all but the
                      speediest heroes with the +50 movespeed BoTs offer you over
                      Arcane Boots. If you utilize this item correctly, it shouldn't
                      slow down your farm at all. You should be split-farming nearly
                      all the time whilst you know where your enemies are, scooping up
                      farm across the map and joining your allies for fights.

                      Some games you just know that you'll need a Force Staff.
                      If you don't have a good sense of what I mean, just try to
                      imagine what could possibly go wrong after you Blink+Stun
                      into the enemy's lineup. If there are enough ways for you
                      to get locked down instantly or stunned/silenced out of
                      Sand Storm, then you're most likely going to need a Force.
                      The timing for this item should pretty much always be
                      directly after Blink Dagger, but keep in mind that the
                      biggest cost associated with this item is the slot. You
                      would prefer to use those item slots for scaling damage
                      if you're a core Sand King, so maybe even consider skipping
                      Blink Dagger for an early Force Staff (or getting a late one)
                      if you know the conditions will be bad enough (Zeus,
                      Spectre, and Clockwerk are some examples of enemies that
                      could force you to forego early Blink).

                      Soul Booster, and indeed this buildup, just got nerfed by
                      6.87, but the theory behind a fast Octarine Core still stands.
                      Building it up this way gives you a nice round item build,
                      giving you tons of mobility for your first 2250 and 2000 gold
                      respectively (Blink and BoTs), then giving you raw survivability
                      for your next 2300 gold in the form of Soul Booster's stats.
                      The 2700 gold leap from Soul Booster to Octarine can be a difficult
                      stretch if you end up struggling with your rotations or lose
                      your lane to farm due to push or gank activity, but the payoff
                      is more than worth it. Don't be afraid to insert another small
                      item after completing Soul Booster but before finishing Octarine
                      if it would solidify your mid-game though, for example with
                      a Eul's, Force Staff or Veil.

                      BKB is a timing item, meaning that you want to pick it up
                      right before you go into an important teamfight. Of course
                      there will be games where your opponents try to counter you
                      with Zeus or Silencer, and in those games you may be forced
                      to get BKB at a non-optimal time, but in general never allow
                      yourself to feel forced into getting BKB. Don't pick Sand King
                      into a situation that you know will force out a BKB—there are
                      SO many other heroes that can fill a similar niche who won't
                      need it (think Earthshaker, who can just Fissure into Force
                      Staff even while taking damage or silenced). Also remember
                      that BKB won't prevent you from having your Blink Dagger disabled
                      by physical damage (like Spectre's Haunt), or from having your
                      ultimate channeling interrupted by BKB-piercing disables
                      (like Global Silence).

                        You can totally follow this guide and ignore my recommendation
                        to get Octarine first, but you should really try it at least once.
                        The only other hero who you could really get Octarine this early
                        on seems to be Death Prophet, but why? Naga and sometimes
                        Alchemist like the item for their Illusion/Radiance shenanigans,
                        but when it comes to spellcasters like SK and DP, it seems to me
                        that an early Octarine makes the most sense on heroes with both
                        multiple short cooldown spells AND a long-cooldown ultimate that
                        they absolutely RELY on. Exorcism is the sole ability that allows
                        Death Prophet to be scary in teamfights and to take objectives,
                        and for Sand King I think Epicenter is an easy comparison. Sand
                        King with an early Octarine increases BOTH the tempo at which he
                        takes major engagements AND uses his stun/escapes in fights, which
                        is far more noticeable on Sand King than on a hero like Zeus, for
                        example, who still does plenty of damage with his Q/W alone and
                        doesn't have a flash-farming mechanism like DP/SK do to help
                        them get their Octarine faster. It's a lot like heroes such as
                        Invoker, Queen of Pain, and Rubick who get Aghanim's Scepter
                        early because it gives Cooldown Reduction—Octarine just happens
                        to be beneficial enough to Sand King that he can rush it to fill
                        that same role. Lastly, if you look at the charts below you'll
                        see that the Damage Per Second increase from Octarine is roughly
                        equal to that of Veil (25% more damage vs 25% more spell casts,
                        therefore Veil is slightly stronger before you have active
                        items like Eblade while Octarine is slightly stronger after you
                        have active items), with the key difference being that you can
                        benefit fully from a Veil of Discord on your ally, but obviously
                        can't have someone else build Octarine for you. This item makes
                        core Sand King work in a way that seemed startlingly strong the
                        first time I tried it, and I think you'll find the same thing too.

                      You're probably thinking "Whoa whoa, Aether AFTER
                      Aghanim's? Why get the more expensive item first?". Well,
                      when it comes to range extension on Sand King, Aghanim's
                      does a WHOLE lot more for you.  Anyone who would ever
                      think of getting Aether Lens first, before even Blink is
                      missing the point of the item entirely, as it has its
                      greatest effect after you have multiple targeted spells
                      (plus items, such as your Blink) versus the early game,
                      where you have only one (Burrow). Aghanim's makes SK
                      perhaps <i>the</i> single strongest initiator because of
                      his instant AoE stun (actually 2000 speed, and 3000 with
                      Aghs, but close enough). Aghanim's actually <i>doubles</i>
                      your Burrow range, while Aether gives only a 30% increase.

                      Aether Lens is a fantastic item for anyone with initiation or
                      nuking duties, and Sand King is no exception—he has both.
                      The key is not to rely on it as an early core item, as 5% damage
                      and 200 range on 1, potentially 2 spells if you have Blink is <i>so</i>
                      not worth it. The item slot is the greatest cost associated here,
                      but the nice part is it's cheap enough that you can sell it without
                      much regret if you end up needing to itemize defensively or decide
                      to pick up more damage. Note that this logic explains why heroes with
                      4 targeted active abilities, like Lion or Bane or Shadow Shaman,
                      benefit so much from an early Aether Lens.

                      Sand King's function on a team can vary slightly depending
                      on your allies, but, in general, besides your responsibility
                      to help teammates by stunning as much as possible during
                      fights, your next goal is to pick off as many key targets
                      as possible with Epicenter. The more you play Sand King, the
                      more you might notice that oftentimes you'll be very close
                      to finishing off the key target you go on—these are the
                      situations that beg for you to get Dagon. The item often pays
                      for itself this way, plus it's the most cose effective item
                      choice besides Veil/Aether by DPS per gold and the recent
                      Intelligence buff in 6.87 gives it a free +1% damage. One note
                      about upgrading your Dagon however: don't. The only situation
                      where upgrading Dagon makes sense is when you've filled your
                      other item slots or you're stomping so hard that the instant damage
                      boost for 1250 gold is more valuable than saving for an Eblade,
                      which you obviously prefer after Dagon 1 if the game is going to
                      keep going because it boosts your Epicenter damage.

                      Ethereal Blade (Eblade) is a criminally underbought item for
                      how large of a boost it gives nuking heroes like Sand King,
                      but there are some good reasons for this. Besides the obvious
                      factors like its cost, the fact that it takes up an item slot
                      and offers relatively useless stats, the main reason Ethereal
                      Blade is difficult to use is that it has a projectile, and a slow
                      one at that. Compare this to items like Veil, which is easy
                      to target and affects all enemies in the AoE, or Aether Lens,
                      which has no active at all. If you practice working Eblade into
                      your Burrow+Epi combo, you'll find that you can actually get
                      the Ethereal damage amplification to cover the entire Epicenter
                      duration (Eblade debuff and Epicenter both last 3 seconds), but
                      this REQUIRES the use of shift-queuing to be at all reliable in
                      a chaotic fight. Definitely practice this combo before you
                      start buying Eblade in real games!

                      Veil is an incredible item for a hero like Sand King who
                      can deal boatloads of magic damage in an AoE, but the best
                      thing about it is that you can get one of your supports to
                      buy it for you. While there is a new trend with Intelligence
                      cores buying Veil before their Blink Daggers even on heroes
                      like Puck, and pretty commonly on Zeus, as a Sand King you
                      don't stand to benefit much from the stats of Veil, and as
                      mentioned elsewhere you stand to gain much more value per
                      item slot if you're allowed to go for items like Octarine,
                      Aghs, and Aether Lens that directly buff Burrowstrike.
                      The best situation for a Veil on Sand King is when he's a
                      support himself, or if he really needs the early armor
                      because of a dangerous lane matchup.

                      Shiva's Guard is the armor item you want to get, when you
                      need armor that is. The AoE damage it adds is especially strong
                      for you as a Sand King, plus the slow stacks nicely with
                      Epicenter's and all that intelligence obviously helps too.
                      The only real downside of Shiva's is that it limits your
                      damage output against a single target, as you can see in
                      some of the charts below. Considering how expensive Shiva's
                      is you should really only get it for the defensive capabilities,
                      especially when you're behind. You can pre-cast Shiva's before
                      Blinking in and the blast will follow you, the AoE damage
                      plus Octarine gives you a nice bonus heal, and compared to
                      targeted items like Dagon/Eblade/Sheep you'll be much more
                      likely to get it off before dying if you're losing fights.

                        Eul's on Sand King is mainly to counter silences. You can
                        also get Eul's Scepter to simply give yourself an additional
                        window to try and get your Blink Dagger off cooldown and escape
                        like a Puck would, but in general Force Staff is more useful
                        in those situations since the escape is not guaranteed and you'll
                        want to get into a new position for your next Burrow rather than
                        staying in the middle of the fight usually. The mana regeneration
                        and movement speed from Eul's are absolutely incredible for SK,
                        but since the item's active gives you no real offensive synergy
                        there are other items that serve you better (special shoutout
                        to Eul's Scepter into Epicenter though, which can work against
                        enemies with no defensive items or mobility spells... but please
                        don't rely on this combo).

                      Scythe of Vyse (Sheepstick) is the best disable money can
                      buy, and for an initiating hero with heavy mana needs like
                      Sand King it's the perfect item to fill that last slot. When
                      should you go for more disable rather than more damage? If
                      your allies are getting destroyed by an enemy physical damage
                      carry getting in their face, definitely grab a Sheepstick.
                      The other situation is when you know you can pick off an
                      enemy with an important teamfight spell, but some item or
                      spell is preventing you from getting the damage off. Sheep
                      gives you an excellent window to channel Epicenter against
                      solo targets, plus it gives you a way to disable key targets
                      like enemies supports with channeled spells without putting
                      your body in harm's way, as you must when stunning someone
                      with Burrow.

                always go wrong, and thus your builds in practice will certainly

                  Burrowstrike every 8.25s, this build absolutely maximizes the
                  potential teamfight control for our slippery sand friend.
                  It also provides the most mana of any build listed, with 2.3k
                  mana and ~13 mana regen at level 16, and 2.7k mana with ~18
                  mana regen at level 25. Feel free to improvise in your
                  matches, but I find this inverted buildup with Aether Lens
                  late to be very resilient, as in you are unlikely to need to
                  deviate, and smooth, as in you gain power steadily until
                  reaching 6-slots. Even past these six-slots you can itemize
                  further with Refresher Orb on a courier, or Ethereal Blade in
                  place of Aether Lens potentially, but as the chart below
                  shows the real key to this build is initiation range and the
                  manapool/mana regen to keep it up in a late-game fight.

                  If you feel like blowing enemies up instead of turning them
                  into pigs, this is the build for you. Aether Lens on just
                  Ethereal Blade and Blink Dagger may not seem like much justification
                  for the item over a stronger alternative like Veil, but the
                  extra range on Eblade especially can make your late-game
                  skirmishing abilities seriously scary. Keep in mind that Sand
                  King's item builds are VERY flexible, and all of the builds
                  listed here are subject to experimentation. You can hybridize
                  the baseline build with defensive capabilities by adding a Eul's
                  or BKB instead of Aether Lens, for example. Just keep in mind what
                  order items are considered Core (as in you'll get them eventually),
                  and which are just a luxury (all the items listed under Situational
                  or Extension, although Aghanim's is definitely pretty Core too).

                  One problem that the above build suffers with is a lack of mana
                  regeneration, and if you're going to be using a cooldown-reduced
                  level 5 Dagon you'll definitely need some of that. With a ridiculous
                  11.25s cooldown 800 damage nuke (600 after reductions) you can
                  really deal some damage... this of course after you amass something
                  well over 25k gold, and you won't be getting that fat without
                  dominating the early-to-mid game. I would only shoot for a bloated
                  build like this if I were really snowballing, otherwise smaller
                  items like Aether to fill your slots and quickly multiply the power
                  of your Burrowstrike and inventory are often better.

                  Sometimes you need a defensive item. Or two. This one has
                  two, counting Shiva's. Between Eul's and BKB, the one that
                  ruins your item progression less tends to be Eul's,
                  since it does fill your mana needs and makes you a speedy lil
                  devil with BoTs. BKBs are pretty much only absolutely
                  neccessary when you get hard-countered and need a sure way to
                  get into the fight, such as against Pugna or Zeus. You
                  have to BKB preemptively to get Epicenter off in most
                  situations which means that BKB will start dwindling fast, so
                  definitely hold off on a BKB purchase until you get at least
                  one major item before breaching highground timed with that
                  BKB purchase, if you can afford to. If not I'd say try to
                  address the issue in the draft stage to give your Sand King
                  some room to breathe, e.g. get Omniknight to protect your
                  core SK from enemy Zeus or Silencer picks when possible, that
                  or rotate him to support. Playing Sand King in games where
                  you'll be forced to itemize defensively is not fun.

                <p>
                  BKB is an item that wins games, but sometimes loses them too.
                  The first thing about building BKB on Sand King is don't get
                  forced into it unless you absolutely have to. Especially as
                  a core SK you need that farm to accelerate and scale in
                  teamfights, and BKB gives you neither more spell damage nor
                  a way to farm faster. I really prefer to get BKB after
                  Octarine or generally as late as possible, so the first few
                  lengthy charges have maximum impact, but you get BKB whenever
                  you need it. It will always be there for you, if you chicken
                  out. Sometimes, like against a Silencer for example, all you
                  need is a vision advantage to outplay the opponent and force
                  them to waste their global ultimate (same with Zeus).

                  This type of build is usually a reaction to either an especially
                  bad lane or a specific enemy hero that warrants mobility that
                  isn't disabled by damage (like Blink is). Clockwerk is a perfect
                  example of a hero that can only really be countered by saving
                  whoever he Cogs with a Force Staff, whether that be yourself
                  or otherwise, but there's a plethora of other situations that
                  may arise. Hard carries that are vulnerable to kiting, like
                  Ursa, make good heroes to get Force Staff against, and in higher
                  competitive play in general the value of a Force Staff rises
                  because there are more chances for game-changing teamplay.
                  Never discount Force Staff first as an early item on Sand King,
                  but don't just get randomly. This type of defensive build with
                  Tranquils, Soul Ring, AND a Force Staff first means you won't
                  be forced to save up anywhere near 2250 gold (1000 at most for
                  the Staff of Wizardry in the Force Staff), but it does mean
                  you'll be hard-pressed to start snowballing as hard. This guide
                  in general tends to favor more lean builds that forego potentially
                  wasteful small regen items like Soul Ring, which you'll never
                  build into a Bloodstone, but in games where you expect you'll
                  have time to just farm a lane quietly Soul Ring is perhaps the
                  best way to just nuke down waves and farm/push, not to mention
                  jungle infinitely should you run out of lane creeps.

                  When it comes to killing someone tanky, this is the build you'll
                  need. Not counting extra Caustic procs, this full combo including
                  Epicenter does a whopping ~2,300 damage to a single target, if you
                  hit it all. And that's with only a Dagon 1! Obviously this type of
                  all-in magic burst build is quite easily counterable (Linken's
                  Sphere, Lotus Orb, BKB), so it's a relatively situational build,
                  but even the most coordinated enemies won't be able to stop you
                  from getting solo-pickoffs <i>somewhere</i> on the map with a build
                  like this. If your team has a farmed hard carry the control from
                  a Sheepstick is generally more useful for Sand King (you'll have
                  some slight mana issues with a build like this with no mana regen
                  item), but if you were going to try and solo carry as a Sand King,
                  this is definitely the build. It's highly possible that you kill
                  two or three enemies with one combo after you have this much raw
                  damage, you just have to think on your feet to make sure you choose
                  the correct targets.

                  Some people might not like the Octarine idea, or maybe you simply
                  don't have the mana to support all that cooldown reduction. A lot
                  of people also seem to like the early Aether Lens, and such a
                  decision actually pairs quite nicely with the decision here to get
                  an early Dagon 1. Boots of Travel to keep moving around the map and
                  keep the pressure on, plus Aether-boosted Dagon to finish off kills
                  is quite a satisfying, and not altogether overly expensive combo!
                  Aghanim's provides a fair bit of damage and the extra range is
                  crucial to making this type of catch-out ganker build work, so your
                  6-slot becomes pretty obvious if we're exclusing Octarine and looking
                  to maximize damage. Just have a teammate grab Veil and you're all set.

                  This build is your secret weapon against illusion heroes. That's
                  basically the only reason to go Aghanim's first as well, as Blink
                  Dagger does a fantastic job of netting you kills for only 2,250
                  gold if that's really all you need. When it comes to brutally,
                  sadistically destroying illusion heroes by exploding them in a
                  pool of their own filthy illusions, that's when you want to rush
                  Aghanim's and make them leave the game all the more quickly.

                  With less guaranteed farm than a laning Sand King, support
                  SK players must be more frugal, and stick to smaller items
                  that can be easily completed during the early-mid game.
                  Octarine early is a great build but it's much more acceptable
                  to let it slip here because you just can't afford it, and
                  to stick to control or defensive items. Iron Talon and
                  Tranquils together make Sand King a stellar jungler with no
                  need to return to base, although a second point in Sand Storm
                  early is a must so that you can do two camps a minute with the
                  30s cooldown. Stacking is of the utmost importance to high-level
                  jungle Sand King play, so practice it several times in a lobby
                  before taking it to online play. You need to be able to
                  reach level 4 by 4 minutes in the jungle, on BOTH Radiance
                  and Dire. I prefer to use an empty lobby, turn on cheats to
                  give myself a courier (use a command such as -gold 100). This
                  type of "come out of the jungle every once in a while" Sand
                  King tends to be about saving teammates more than anything,
                  so itemizing with a Force Staff and eventual Eul's to later
                  save yourself are all par for the course.

                  Sand King roaming isn't a terribly easy thing to learn,
                  and I certainly can't just explain it all in one neat
                  paragraph. Like any early roaming, especially at a higher
                  level roaming comes down to reading support movements
                  and vision so that you can have some actual surprise when
                  you show up 1025 units away from the enemy's mid-laner out
                  of smoke looking to stun them with a 500 range stun. Timing
                  and teamplay are crucial in these moments, so starting boots
                  and a quick upgrade to Tranquils of Arcanes are a must. At
                  that point, honestly, the easiest way to get your Blink and
                  continue on the path towards winning the game is just to not
                  die. You don't even have to necessarily jungle, or pull-off
                  ninja ganks every 2 minutes, but staying alive and participating
                  wherever you can are all you really need to do. This type of
                  playstyle tends to lead itself to teamfighting and showing up
                  for objectives, so an early Veil along with an even earlier
                  Aether Lens (mainly out of convenience since you presumably
                  wouldn't find enough farm for an Octarine) means you'll be
                  able to contribute a heckuva lot in mid-game fights while
                  both scaling late and staying available to support.

                  This is pretty much just here for completeness, if you want
                  a totally vanilla build that doesn't acknowledge how awesome
                  Burrowstrike scales then this is the build for you. An instant
                  disable that isn't Burrowstrike, plus a shiny golden button
                  to make sure you get off Epicenter, and a convenient Aether
                  along the way, because why not, plus that Force Staff you seemed
                  reluctant to part with. Aghanim's is a much better item for
                  your 6-slot if we're talking plentiful farm, but if you're
                  looking to play an impactful SK on a shoestring budget this
                  type of build works whether he's in a core OR a support role.

                You could always make the argument for safelane Sand King, but inevitably you'd
                have a hard time convincing your pub teammates to let you do it. Now that it's
                become the overwhelming favorite with pros I think we'll start to see pubs follow
                suit. Sand King can dominate all but the most difficult 1v1 lanes, and should he
                get aggressive 1v2 or 1v3 laned, he can still survive unlike so many squishy
                carries.

              <h4><img src="img/40px-Bottle_icon.png" width="32px"> Midlane</h4>
                Mid is a difficult lane to send Sand King to without knowing the matchup
                ahead of time, primarily because so many of the common mid heroes are ranged
                ones that would easily out-farm you, and possibly kill you. You need a
                short-range hero like Gyrocopter, Weaver, or Morphling, or a melee hero,
                for Caustic Finale to be effective. As long as Sand King's 1v1 opponent is
                less than 400 range, he should be fine, although even at the pro level
                we've seen multiple instances of Sand King doing fine in the midlane
                against more traditional ranged mid heroes (like LGD.Maybe's recent game
                versus VG.R Mikasa's Queen of Pain).

              <h4><img src="img/40px-Stout_Shield_icon.png" width="32px"> Offlane</h4>
                Offlane is the classic lane for core Sand King, and something a lot of
                you may already have experience with. Since SK can fall back to the jungle
                it generally works quite well even in the face of an impossible lane, BUT
                now that Sand King is such a strong laner (thanks to Caustic), you do have
                the potential to invest your skill points aggressively and contest the lane
                for CS at levels 1-3. Always plan to get a point in Sand Storm by at least
                level 4 though, in case the lane just gets too dangerous.
            </div><!--/.row-->
            <div class="row" style="padding-top: 8px;">
              <h4><img src="img/40px-Iron_Talon_icon.png" width="32px"> Jungle</h4>
                Professional Sand King players classically play Sand King as a jungler,
                and now, despite the change giving jungle camps magic resistance last
                patch, his new 50 second duration Sand Storm means SK will always be
                able to clear the first double Stack he gets to reach a quick level 3-4.
                Two points in Sand Storm is enough for nearly any early game jungling
                needs—more points is primarily useful so you can use the 18 and 10
                second cooldown Sand Storm multiple times during a teamfight.
            </div><!--/.row-->

              <h4><img src="img/40px-Boots_of_Speed_icon.png" width="32px"> Roaming</h4>
                Roaming to get early game ganks is difficult, and requires high levels
                of coordination with your team. Your best bet is usually to get up some
                early stacks between ganks, possibly grabbing a second point of Sand Storm
                to help you clear them. Some pro Sand Kings even used to get more points
                in Sand Storm, but today with the Caustic buffs it seems prudent to
                make use of the skill while it's most effective—during the early game.
                Even one point for a roaming SK gives him the full 30%, 3s slow. That's
                like a free super Orb of Venom!
