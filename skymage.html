              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                I'll write this
              </p>
              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                A highly placed mage in the court of the Ghastly Eyrie,
                Dragonus lives a troubled existence. Sworn by birth to protect
                whomever sits within the Nest of Thorns, he hates the current
                Skywrath queen with all his soul. As a youth, high-born, he was
                a friend and companion to the eldest Skywrath princess,
                Shendelzare, first in line for the Nest. He had loved her
                warmly and unshakably, but as his studies took hold, his mind
                turned to arcane learning and the mastery of Skywrath sorcery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obsessed with matters aetherial, he missed the mundane signs of
                courtly treachery that hinted at a plot against Shendelzare,
                and lost his chance to foil it. When the court was shaken by a
                swift and violent coup, he emerged from his studies to discover
                his oldest and dearest friend had been lost to him. The Nest of
                Thorns now belonged to Shendelzare's ruthless younger sister,
                and Dragonus could do nothing. The magic of the Skywrath Mage
                serves only the sworn protector of the Skywrath scion, so to
                act against the Nest would render him helpless. He clings to
                his post, believing it to be the best hope of one day restoring
                his true love to her rightful place.  Meanwhile, his secret is
                known only to the goddess Scree'auk, whose magic it was
                transformed Shendelzare from a crippled physical creature into
                an embodiment of pure vengeful energy.  While he dreams of
                restoring his beloved queen to the Ghastly Eyrie, he dreams
                even more desperately of restoring Shendelzare herself to a
                fully healed physical form.  The duplicity of his role at court
                tortures him, for he is a noble and good-hearted creature; but
                the worst torture of all is imagining the hatred that Vengeful
                Spirit must hold in her heart for him.

                Skywrath Mage is highly versatile with regards to which role and
                lane he goes, but he's still a hero you want to avoid picking
                early if you can because he's somewhat counterable. Consult
                the following list of hero interactions during your drafts for
                some idea of how each matchup works, but keep in mind that some
                categories on this list refer to 1v1 matchups while others
                are just general notes (hover over the section title for more info).

                      SK excels against these heroes, primarily in lane but
                      also when using his combo, because the extra enemy
                      minions allow CF to be procced multiple times, granting
                      extra damage and also some free CS.

                        Although Furion (Nature's Prophet) himself is pretty
                        squishy, the primary reason why he's weak to SK is his
                        Treants. These are the potentially most numerous summon,
                        sometimes in hordes due to the NP Aghanim's upgrade. As with
                        any hero in this category, either counter Prophet in lane
                        by following him if he tries to relocate permanently, or
                        potentially disrupt his jungle as a support SK by making
                        early rotations. Playing SK in these matchups is like playing
                        Earthshaker and using Echo Slam—if you see Furion surrounded
                        by his creeps, you can easily take him down—sometimes using
                        just Burrowstrike and a Caustic attack or two.

                        Enchantress is a walking oxymoron—her low health
                        means she is especially susceptible to magic burst like
                        Epicenter, BUT she's also perhaps the most resilient
                        jungler there is.  Enchantress is extremely difficult
                        to catch or kill during the early game because of her
                        high movement speed and Untouchable—thus it is not
                        recommended to attempt roaming against any competent
                        Enchantress player.  Instead, the best way to play this
                        matchup is as a core, in lane. An early level 6,
                        whether laning against Enchantress or not, since the
                        1v1 matchup isn't as particularly strong here for the
                        SK, means an early Epicenter, which means dead Bambi.
                        Early on Enchantress is especially susceptible to magic
                        burst since her Strength is the lowest in the game. As
                        a greedy jungler, SK can potentially punish Enchantress
                        by farming his team's jungle first, and then rotating
                        to counter-gank the offlane or roaming Enchantress, but
                        this style of play is definitely most risky against an
                        Enchantress compared to other junglers.

                        This is the #1 clearest situation to pick a Skywrath Mage.
                        Many tiny spiders means SK can farm up a storm, shut
                        down the weaker Arachnid in lane, and potentially

                        against Broodmother—and watch out for Web tricks!
                        Look at the draft and predict the way Brood would
                        normally lane, then guess which lane she would go to if

                        ONLY reason to pick SK against Brood is the lane matchup.
                        If you treat the matchup this way you'll be much more
                        successful, as Skywrath Mage lineups tend
                        to run out of steam unless another core takes over
                        or the wombo-combo teamfight is unstoppable. Brood

                        1v1, this lane is definitely a close contest for CS
                        until SK hits level 3, or maybe even level 2 if he gets
                        aggressive on Beastmaster under a creep wave
                        successfully—but the matchup tends to favor Skywrath Mage
                        overall because in late-game teamfights, he can always
                        afford to hang back and wait for the Beastmaster to go
                        in first. Hawk vision can definitely make life hard for
                        a clumsy SK caught in the trees, but always remember in
                        such situations that a little purple puff of some Smoke
                        of Deceit can make the whole play work for only 50g. If
                        you play AROUND the Beastmaster, he'll be the one
                        getting hunted.

                        AA is also a wonderful hero to have on your team as an
                        SK, but as enemies you'll only really have to contend
                        with getting scouted out by Ice Vortex or maybe having
                        your Blink disabled by his ultimate. In lane, AA has
                        pretty much no way to stop you, so feel free to walk
                        up and give him a tap—just beware of the Cold Feet plus
                        follow-up if you dive in with Burrowstrike.

                        Just be aware that Bounty Hunter would love to

                        SK is one of the best heroes at catching heroes with
                        escapes because Burrowstrike is practically instant,
                        catching these heroes out before they can use their
                        spells to escape. One important note is that SK can
                        basically replace Puck in many drafts because of this
                        capacity—although his stun is slightly shorter in
                        duration than Puck's Silence, Skywrath Mage offers more
                        magical damage.

                        Weaver is so squishy that you will nearly always be
                        able to squash him before Time Lapse comes out. This is
                        a good situation where the aggressive item build can be
                        excellent, as heroes like Weaver are especially
                        vulnerable to being bursted down during the 2.17s
                        window of Burrowstrike's stun. In lane, Weaver is
                        short-ranged once again, making him weak to Caustic and
                        proving for a second time that Crixalis is the king

                        Burrowstrike is not a long enough duration stun to
                        catch out and kill a hero like Storm Spirit with SO
                        much mobility—but you can be the one fast enough to
                        catch him, even with just Burrowstrike. Getting an
                        additional Eul's Scepter or Scythe of Vyse means you
                        can instantly Cyclone or Sheep, channel Epicenter, and
                        chain into your own stun. In lane, remember that Storm
                        Spirit is short-ranged, and thus is quite susceptible
                        to Caustic harass—especially when he goes in for a
                        Remnant.

                        Slark is a tough nut to crack once he hits level 6 and
                        can just slither away from you whenever he wants,
                        but pre-6 especially Slark is not that difficult
                        to lane against, plus the passive nature of Caustic
                        makes it uneconomical for Slark to use his Dark Pact
                        on Caustic should you find yourself able to harass
                        him with it. Stunning this little fish down and
                        bursting him at level 5 should be pretty darned easy,
                        plus even in the late-game you should be quick
                        enough to catch a Slark player with Blink into Burrow
                        before he can Dark Pact. Consider Blinking on top of
                        the Slark player to minimize his time to react if
                        you're having trouble catching one in your game.

                        Each Meepo clone does count separately as far as Caustic
                        Finale is concerned, but since you'll only be able to proc
                        the active death Finale burst once for Meepo this matchup
                        is not quite as favorable as the illusion-based heroes.
                        Attacking multiple Meepos just to apply the Caustic debuff
                        and deal multiple passive AoE procs is still a viable
                        strategy here though, so never discount the lane matchup
                        1v1 or even 1v2 without a strong zoning support. Meepo
                        may still try to Earthbind and Poof you down once he hits
                        level 4-5, but this is an easy enough situation to escape
                        if you save Burrowstrike or simply don't let him bind you
                        under his creep wave.

                        While not covered under the Weaver section, let it be said
                        here that Linken's Sphere carries like Weaver and Morphling
                        can be quite annoying for a core SK because Linken's will
                        always block Burrowstrike, even if it's not hero-targeted.
                        Bearing this in mind, it may be prudent to pick-up an
                        additional active item like Eul's against these heroes, IF
                        they go Linken's Sphere, to quickly pop their Linken's and
                        follow-through with your Burrow combo. Morphling can be
                        especially frustrating to play against because he will
                        Strength morph his way out of the fight if you don't burst
                        him, but even in these cases Skywrath Mage has the advantage
                        with a lower cooldown mobility spell and Caustic slow, so
                        long as the Morphling doesn't instantly replicate out.
                        Morphling is also low-range enough to be hit will Caustic
                        while going in for last hits himself, so for all intents
                        and purposes you can treat the Morphling 1v1 matchup as
                        favorably as you would the matchup with a melee hero.

                        Tinker LOVES to hide in trees and use March of the Machines
                        to farm up the lane, then Boots of Travel out without being
                        seen—use this against him by placing wards on the high
                        cliffs around the outside of the map ("Tinker wards"), then
                        lie in wait in some patch of trees for the Tinker to come
                        along. Since Tinker players tend to get an Ethereal Blade
                        of their own, late-game Tinker can be especially helpless
                        against a wise Skywrath Mage player's ganks, that is unless
                        the Tinker is forced to go BKB or Linken's. Either way
                        lane matchups against a Tinker 1v1 are not that unfavorable,
                        just watch for the Lasers right as you go for last-hits.
                        These plays are opportunities for you to dive in with Burrow
                        if you already have Caustic on a creep or two and aren't
                        too low on health, but consider avoiding the 1v1 altogether
                        if there's a more suitable ranged laner on your team.

                      All of these heroes improve SK's ability to function in

                      Since you'll like go into Sand Storm or scoot out with a Force Staff
                      after getting off your Epicenter during the fight, Skywrath Mage is
                      actually a fairly safe hero to just cast Blood Rage on directly,
                      allowing him to potentially heal up from any creeps or heroes he
                      finishes off with Epicenter and Burrow when he goes in. The real
                      question here is how to lane Bloodseeker and Skywrath Mage on the same
                      team—all I have here is theories, but I'd say that putting
                      Bloodseeker either in the jungle or as another core can both work.

                      While the obvious synergy here is simply Repel to allow
                      Skywrath Mage to skip BKB himself, the same could be said about
                      literally any other core hero that's item slot limitted.
                      In this case Omni makes a great partner for Skywrath Mage because
                      he always puts his body into the middle of the fight, and
                      tossing out that Purify onto a Burrow and/or Epicenter
                      is often all you need to take down a tanky opponent as the
                      Skywrath Mage. Finding a laning situation to make use of this
                      combo is definitely a challenge, but the best is actually
                      just a dual offlane against some melee carry and weaker
                      support, for example Spectre/Dazzle or Sven/Lion. 2v2,
                      SK and Omni are nearly as deadly of a duo as Omni and Tusk.

                      Undying is a bit of an awkward hero to lane on the same team
                      as Skywrath Mage these days. Since Undying traditionally excels
                      in such situations, your best bet may be to put Skywrath Mage solo
                      safelane while offensive tri-laning with the Undying, who can
                      not only make short work of the enemy's three heroes with his
                      Tombstone Zombies, but also later on will amplify up his opponents
                      with his ultimate, Flesh Golem, so that when Skywrath Mage eventually
                      rotates for a gank he can deal even more damage.

                    Of all the combinations with Skywrath Mage and his Epicenter,
                    wombo combo is often the most obvious. Keep in mind that
                    putting all your team's eggs in one basket by relying on
                    a large number of long-cooldown ultimates is risky.
                    Losing one teamfight can mean a long period of crippled
                    engagements while waiting for cooldowns to come back up.

                    Miss someone with your Burrow? Catch them before they scurry
                    away with a Vacuum! This is one of the deadliest combo picks
                    with ANY teamfight ultimate, and Skywrath Mage is no exception.
                    The ability to clean up enemies with huge Epicenters, plus
                    elevate a simple Burrow into a ravage on the whole other team,
                    makes this simple synergy invaluable. You can also make
                    use of Surge plus Ion Shell onto Skywrath Mage in lane, which is
                    often something your enemies won't expect but which can happen
                    with either a smoke rotation or a jungle DS/SK.

                    As a teammate, Tidehunter makes one of the best setups
                    for your Epicenter channeling, since if you time it right
                    the enemies will be stationary as you line up the perfect
                    Burrowstrike to chain after the Ravage. Offlane Tidehunter
                    and safelane SK is a fairly flat combo that can be punished
                    if you reveal it too early in the draft, so try to hide at
                    least one of these picks until 5th (as with most of the
                    heroes in the wombo section).

                    Enigma is a significantly faster jungler than Skywrath Mage,
                    plus he's the perfect hero to grab an early Mek instead
                    of a Blink, allowing your team to push and group up earlier
                    and allowing SK to do the initiating. While this combo is
                    somewhat punishable in the draft, you may be able to actually
                    throw your opponent off by picking these two ambiguous heroes
                    early and laning them in a unique configuration, or if your
                    enemy overreacts and plays a style they're not comfortable
                    with. Opponents will definitely be scared if they see Enigma
                    and SK early during the draft, so you should at least be
                    aware of this before you grab them together.

                    A long-range AoE initiator like Warlock is the perfect setup
                    for your majesty's carefully crafted Epicenter. Warlock is
                    viable as a support these days and can certainly zone out an
                    enemy if your core SK gets an unfavorable lane matchup, but
                    even as a core Warlock makes a good companion for Skywrath Mage.
                    The utter devestation of Fatal Bonds into Epicenter is enough
                    to make an entire team crumble on its own.

                    Magnus is a lot like Tidehunter in that you'll definitely
                    benefit from his setup if he gets an ult off—the difference
                    here is that Magnus's initiation is generally much less
                    reliable than Tidehunter's (somewhat on par with your own
                    as an SK really). The nice thing here is that Magnus being
                    generally a mid hero means you'll be able to either safe-
                    or off-lane your team's SK.

                    Holding potentially multiple members of the enemy team still
                    with a Kinetic Field and, potentially, Static Field makes your
                    life WAY easy as Skywrath Mage. Although there's no direct damage

                    As teammates, SK and Faceless really make a powerful duo—Epicenter
                    can deal its damage even if you blink into the Chronosphere,
                    allowing you to potentially followup with a Burrow stun while
                    your enemies are Time Dilated. Other than Zeus and Skywrath there
                    are few magic damage dealers that pair as well with Void as SK
                    does, although having them both on the same team implies that one
                    of them will most likely be safelane. If you can run a support
                    Skywrath Mage that also works especially well here, as the new FV
                    really enjoys finding his farm early and may need to rotate around
                    to find a decent lane. SK has the same finicky needs as a core and
                    so may not make the most reliable partner to grab early in a draft.

                    Phoenix is a fun combo to run with Skywrath Mage, but their synergy
                    is a bit difficult to take advantage of. The most common play
                    by far will be Skywrath Mage blinking in to Burrow stun an enemy that's
                    trying to take down the Supernova, but more effectively you would
                    combine SK and Phoenix with someone like a Treant to ensure that
                    the Phoenix ult goes off first, then put the Epicenter damage
                    on top of the the Supernova stun to let SK do the cleanup. A
                    support Phoenix or even an offlane one with a mid or safelane
                    SK can really result in powerful earlygame teamfights for you,
                    assuming that your lanes go as you would hope. If they don't,
                    that's where some strong support picks come in, to reassure these
                    more utilitarian cores don't falter against a snowballing enemy
                    team with potential hard-er carries.

                    While much less straightforward to execute than the other
                    lane combos mentioned in this section, this is a classic
                    one that works best when the Skywrath Mage is the one initiating.
                    As either a support roamer or just a lane partner doing some
                    sneaking around, try popping out from behind some trees as
                    SK and Burrow stunning your lane opponents, allowing Lina
                    the time to follow up with her LSA. The extreme amount of
                    magic burst betweeen these two should be able to level all
                    but the absolute tankiest opponents (BKBs can be a problem
                    too obviously). Picking this much magic damage, especially
                    early on in the draft, can leave your team open to being
                    countered, so be prepared to be creative with your laning
                    to salvage your early game if you do.

                    Sven's Storm Hammer is simply one of the best stuns to follow
                    up on. Not only is it easy to hit, but it does enough damage
                    to soften weaker enemies up for a potential Caustic Finale,
                    maybe adding enough damage to turn a difficult gank into an easy
                    one. Sven's Cleave allows him to make short work of Burrow-stunned
                    targets later on, so consider pairing the two with another
                    synergistic hero like Dark Seer to really emphasize your combo's
                    strength at all stages in the game.

                    The slow from Frost Blast is easily enough to catch a fleeing enemy
                    during the early game, usually, but if not there's always the
                    fact that you're probably destroying the enemy on experience
                    with a Lich on your team—especially if he's in your lane as an SK.
                    Lich would be a fairly decent candidate to get an early Veil to
                    support his SK as well, although this is certainly not a common
                    pickup by any means.

                    This combo has been proven so potent that I had to add it
                    immediately—Na'vi has shown specifically that offlane SK with
                    Dazzle is a very potent kill-lane, and one that's both safe
                    thanks to the heals and Shallow Grave to keep things from going
                    South too quickly, and which will often be underestimated,
                    leading to a kill. The slow from Poison Touch could be nice,
                    but the Shallow Grave to save your Skywrath Mage diving under tower
                    is just too strong to pass up. Toss out that Shadow Wave heal
                    after SK goes diving in to proc caustic on a wave of creeps,
                    and practically anyone will go down (even a 10 armor Terrorblade).

                    This is another easy to execute lane combo—just Fortune's
                    End long enough for your SK to walk up and stun. It's
                    actually a strong enough combo that the two heroes can
                    roam together as supports if they have suitable targets
                    to find, although a simple roaming Oracle on top of
                    your core farming Skywrath Mage works too. Taking Oracle
                    out of the pool against your Skywrath Mage is always helpful
                    too, as his Fate's Edict can completely turn around
                    an Epicenter gank.

                    Aghanim's upgrade can make him a formidable teammate for SK
                    as well as a decent lane partner. Jungling your SK and then
                    roaming to the Wraith King's lane can work, as well as
                    farming the SK and having a roaming WK to stun into the lane,

                    Venge can use Magic Missile to set up for Burrowstrike.

                    saving the Skywrath Mage or swapping an enemy into Epicenter,
                    but that means that like the other heroes on this list
                    Venge makes a good support (and rarely carry) to pair with
                    Skywrath Mage when it comes to Captain's Mode. The lack of
                    any strong synergy means this is a combo you would probably
                    roam them together early and then turn SK into a static
                    jungler or laner, because neither one of these heroes
                    can carry on their own or together, and thus they cannot

                    Sven is one of the classic melee heroes that Skywrath Mage
                    crushes in lane, forcing him to back away from the creeps
                    or risk taking Caustic harassment and Burrow burst damage.
                    You may end up wanting a Eul's/Eblade/Shiva's Guard to
                    mitigate Sven's extreme physical damage later in the game,
                    but hopefully if you get this lane 1v1, or even 1v2 with
                    some weak support, you can likely snowball off the lane
                    while simultaneously denying Sven tons of farm.

                    1v1 thanks to his large health pool, health regeneration,
                    and instant stun to disengage with, but you should always
                    keep in mind that the armor from DK's passive and the damage
                    reduction from his Breathe Fire have NO effect on your magic
                    damage. Early in the game this means the lane is easily a kill
                    lane for the SK, although DK should be able to last hit somewhat
                    safely and harass you back some. Late-game if the DK starts
                    to really tank up with a Pipe or BKB things can get rocky,
                    but hopefully if you end up in this 1v1 you won't let him
                    get that far along, or you'll punish him by running down
                    his charges and keeping up the pace by pushing out waves
                    and teamfighting constantly with the Octarine build.

                    This has got to be one of the very easiest lanes for
                    Skywrath Mage to CS in and kill, but Slardar does have
                    plenty of counterplay potential of his own making this
                    nowhere near the safest 1v1 matchup. Slardar's Crush
                    means he can stun you out of Sand Storm (plus see you
                    during it with his ultimate), and Sprint lets him
                    chase YOU down if you choose to run (if you have Blink
                    and he doesn't you'll get away, but if you both do
                    Slardar can pretty much always catch you, which is rare
                    for Skywrath Mage). Either way, the bonus damage Slardar
                    takes from Sprint does mean that he's an easy enough
                    hero to burst down later on in the game, just be aware
                    of any BKB or Pipe of Insight pickups that would throw
                    you off.

                    Alchemist definitely seems like a an underutilized hero
                    these days, but 1v1 against a Skywrath Mage he will just look
                    silly. Picking up a couple Mangos, as prescribed here, to
                    counteract the tick damage from Acid Spray is the only real
                    adjustment you'll need to make against Alchemist, though as
                    always if you can get his rune at minute 0 he'll be somewhat
                    crippled (temporarily). Later on in the game Alchemist
                    can become quite tanky and hard to burst down, not to mention
                    if he goes Radiance that can interfere with your Blink Dagger,
                    but this give you all the more reason to go for either
                    control in the form of a Scythe of Vyse to catch out a tanky
                    Alchemist, or more burst damage in the form of Dagon/Eblade to
                    punish an Alch for not tanking up enough.

                    Timber was massively buffed in recent patches and
                    also excels against all Strength heroes. In a 1v1
                    lane you'll be close enough for easy Whirling
                    Death harass from him. Timbersaw's bonus armor
                    from the newly buffed Reactive Armor may not
                    help against you much, but the mobility from Timber
                    Chain means he's always going to be quite tough
                    to solo-kill without landing an Epicenter.

                    and slow enough to kill 1v1. A Skywrath Mage pick would surely
                    be enough to force PA into an early BKB, but if not you can
                    literally just keep solo-killing her over and over with
                    Epicenter (although do be mindful of baits if you're playing

                    that he can Time Walk out of any harass damage you
                    do, which will nearly always be in a tight burst
                    that he can neatly walk off. Later on he can potentially
                    catch you with Chronosphere as you go in for Burrow,

                    unless you're absolutely sure (a silence like Skywrath
                    on your team would help). 1v1 you can bully him out of
                    lane, and he'll have a hard time denying your CS without
                    taking heavy Caustic damage, but ultimately you will
                    take over this lane, just be careful.

                      Zeus is the most obvious counter to Skywrath Mage there is, as you

                      Caustic Finale treats Illusions as heroes—in case you
                      didn't know. This allows Skywrath Mage and Caustic Finale,
                      especially with Aghanim's Scepter, can dominate and
                      potentially shut illusion heroes down before they even
                      come online. If CK or PL have a Heart and/or Skadi,
                      Caustic Finale isn't going to even come close to
                      killing them, but with Aghanim's allowing your
                      Burrowstrike to place the full 220 damage CF proc on
                      any enemy illusion, you can definitely do lots of
                      damage to these enemy heroes during the early- to
                      mid-game, and still insta-gib any squishy heroes
                      standing near their swarm of carry illusions late-game.

                      for Skywrath Mage to kill, and a fun hero to use Aghanim's
                      + Burrow against. Try to save Sand Storm for the end of

                      While most heroes will get wrecked in lane by the
                      potential Spirit Lance spam, Skywrath Mage excels in that
                      he can level Sand Storm early to dodge Lances. Making
                      this adjustment lowers your kill potential in the 1v1
                      lane at lower levels, but definitely increases your
                      survivability. Grabbing an Aghanim's before PL tanks up
                      means PL will fear you, perhaps relying on solely
                      pushing with illusions, so vision is always key to
                      these matchups.

                      that when she ends her singing, you can Blink in and
                      stop her team from TPing out instantly or interrupt
                      their carefully orchestrated teamfight. In lane, just

                      CK is a scary opponent in lane, especially because he often
                      brings an IO or other support with him, but in a somewhat
                      fair 1v1 Skywrath Mage can definitely still manhandle this
                      tanky brute. Against a lane with supports, hang back and
                      level Sand Storm early enough to escape their aggression,
                      as it will also let you fall back to the jungle. With
                      a decent Aghanim's timing Skywrath Mage will usually destroy
                      the CK throughout the mid-to-late game, but after fully
                      tanking up CK may just be too strong for SK to take down
                      without items like Veil and Shiva's.

                      Zeus is the most obvious counter to Skywrath Mage there is, as you
                      can pretty much always outplay the SK player by sitting back
                      and disabling his Blink with Thundergod's Wrath—that is until
                      you get a BKB. This matchup is the clearest one of all to pick
                      yourself up a Black King Bar, so plan to itemize defensively
                      if you do get counter-picked.

                      His Nether Ward is one of the easiest ways to get your Blink

                      and Life Drains. Pugna may be squishy, and a bad Pugna player
                      may get himself killed by going ethereal at the wrong moment,
                      but a good Pugna player can ruin your day just like any

                      As the other lowest health hero in the game—tied with
                      Enchantress—Terrorblade is both an easy lane opponent
                      for Skywrath Mage to kill, and a fun hero to use Aghanim's

                      While most heroes will get wrecked in lane by the
                      potential Spirit Lance spam, Skywrath Mage excels in that
                      he can level Sand Storm early to dodge Lances. Making
                      this adjustment lowers your kill potential in the 1v1
                      lane at lower levels, but definitely increases your
                      survivability. Grabbing an Aghanim's before PL tanks up
                      means PL will fear you, perhaps relying on solely
                      pushing with illusions, so vision is always key to
                      these matchups.

                      CK is a scary opponent in lane, especially because he often
                      brings an IO or other support with him, but in a somewhat
                      fair 1v1 Skywrath Mage can definitely still manhandle this
                      tanky brute. Against a lane with supports, hang back and
                      level Sand Storm early enough to escape their aggression,
                      as it will also let you fall back to the jungle. With
                      a decent Aghanim's timing Skywrath Mage will usually destroy
                      the CK throughout the mid-to-late game, but after fully
                      tanking up CK may just be too strong for SK to take down
                      without items like Veil and Shiva's.

                      resist magic, and some of them can also give that buff

                      It should be pretty plain to see, but Rage is stupidly
                      good way for a melee carry like Lifestealer to avoid
                      all of your Epicenter damage, and potentially even the
                      Burrow stun if you aren't on point with your shift-queuing.
                      In lane the SK should actually dominate a 1v1 matchup with
                      Lifestealer where CS is concerned, but you'll have far less
                      kill potential than against other melee laners and be in
                      some danger should the Lifestealer get support rotations.
                      A good Lifestealer player won't be afraid to dive you early
                      on, thanks to his Rage.

                      Rubick, along with the several other heroes listed below, can
                      on very rare occasions ruin your Epicenter initiaton by snatching
                      you (or in some of the cases below, hexing or silencing you) instantly,
                      before you can even get the Burrowstrike off but after blinking in.
                      These kinds of superhuman feats are actually performed by simple
                      shift-queuing of commands usually, but still you must be wary
                      of these outplay potentials, as well as the potential for Rubick
                      to nab one of your spells. None of them is one you particularly
                      want to give Rubick, but Sand Storm is most definitely the one
                      you're most okay handing over, so always try to use that after
                      your initiations if you don't catch Rubick himself. All of

                      which is actually perhaps the number one reason why Rubick sucks
                      to play against as SK. Being that level 1 Null Field was recently
                      buffed to 10% magic resistance, you certainly want to control
                      the Rubick pick after you've grabbed Skywrath Mage, if you can.

                      Ember is definitely a slippery split pusher capable of
                      getting caught by your average SK player, BUT thanks to
                      Flame Guard you'll nearly always find the solo-kill much
                      harder than other similar heroes. If Ember for some reason
                      doesn't have the Flame Guard up, and/or you get an aggressive
                      burst item like Dagon, you can definitely pick off the
                      otherwise somewhat fragile Ember Spirit. Skywrath Mage does
                      have the choice of picking up a Eul's to dispel his Flame
                      Guard, but this combo may simply fail if the Ember has
                      a remnant up that he can leap out to. Not to mention
                      Ember can also respond to you with Linken's or BKB to
                      try and stop your initiations, or even Skadi to tank
                      through them instead.

            <p style="margin: 4px 0 8px 0;">
              It's pretty clear that you want to max Arcane Bolt, but most
              people probably max Seal second regardless of their role. As
              a core Skywrath hoping to get aggressive and chase down my
              lane opponent early on, I tend to prefer maxing Concussive
              Shot second. If you're a support or feel like you won't be
              able to find situations where that -2/4/6 second cooldown
              (16/14/12s at levels 2/3/4) reduction will be useful, go for
              Ancient Seal instead.
            </p>
            <h4>Battle Mage</h4>
            <p>
              Generally you want to be 1/1/1 at level 3, but sometimes
              taking two points in Arcane Bolt is also worth it if you
              don't need Ancient Seal to kill an enemy with no escapes,
              or Concussive against a slow enemy who has an escape.
              Maxing Concussive second gives you more aggressive presence
              throughout extended fights, so if you're mainly going for
              quick precise ganks then Ancient Seal levels may be more
              valuable instead.

                  This is the most aggressive skill build, foregoing early points
                  in Sand Storm to focus on winning the lane, so naturally at
                  level 1 you should abuse your Stout and/or Quelling Blade to
                  to get off Caustic harass on your opponent. If for some reason
                  you're not in a 1v1 lane, keep in mind that you can always
                  do small camps with level 1 Caustic, but this only benefits
                  you if you're in your own safelane of course.

                  Once you have both Burrow and Caustic, you're a kill threat.
                  Generally at level 2 you'll only be able to kill a very inexperienced
                  opponent, but with support gank rotations you can possibly pick
                  off your lane opponent (a hero like Witch Doctor, Skywrath, etc
                  makes a good gank partner, someone with damage and CC). At this
                  point you should only use Burrow for damage on your opponent,
                  not to farm, unless of course you're mid and looking to push
                  the wave before going for a rune. Your damage spike at level
                  3 means you'll want to save your mana for then.

                  kill potential. The lower cost of level 1 Burrowstrike, plus
                  the higher max burst damage of Level 2 Caustic over Level 2 Burrow
                  (if you look at the chart above carefully, you'll see that Caustic
                  provides more absolute damage since you can proc it on a whole creep

                  For max kill potential once you start looking for ganks, take
                  Burrow at levels 4, 5 and 7. It gives you the most range early on
                  in the game, which is usually the factor holding back your kills—

                  Not every build here recommends Epicenter at level 6, and that's
                  because without a Blink Dagger you'll always have a hard time using
                  it. The best way to use an Epicenter without Blink is NOT to clear
                  stacks, no no you must set a trap. Hide in trees (use that Quelling
                  Blade!), wait for someone squishy to walk by (you deal ~600 damage

                  in the trees and Burrow out onto them. This move only works in
                  the early game before people have mobility or defensive items, so
                  take advantage if you can. The combined slows from Caustic and Epi
                  can make even a fast hero significantly slowed as they escape, just
                  avoid using this combo on a Blink hero like Anti-Mage or QoP unless
                  you brought some stun-lock.

                  With max Burrow you can safely roam looking for pick-offs, but
                  more likely you'll be getting close to Blink Dagger money at this
                  point, and if so you'll want to find an empty lane and farm away.
                  Obviously if you had points in Sand Storm you could alternatively
                  jungle, but keep in mind that this point of this particular build
                  is to be in a lane, getting all the last hits and zoning out any
                  enemies who are dumb enough to stand near you. You're the KING
                  of this lane, so make sure that all other 9 players know it.

                  What's this? A point in SAND STORM? Why would we want that? Well
                  if you haven't deviated from this lunatic guide yet then I might
                  as well give you an explanation: it's to escape. At this point,
                  level 8, you should almost certainly be getting your Blink, and
                  now is the moment when you'll need Sand Storm not as a jungling
                  tool but as an escape. After you Blink deep into the enemy team
                  a time or two without Sand Storm, you'll stop going 4-0-4-1 or
                  whatever it was Moo did one DC game recently. The extra damage
                  from Caustic is amazing, and costs no mana, but you do need
                  Sand Storm by around the time you have Blink.

                  More Caustic means both faster jungling and more kill potential,
                  so snap it up. Lane creeps are easy to blow up with one Burrow
                  at this point, but the magic resistance and higher health pools
                  of jungle creeps means it's way more efficient to utilize just
                  W and E when jungling, if you decide to. With one point in Sand
                  Storm you can certainly do any camp or stack you want to, but
                  you'll have to stand there and take some damage while you apply
                  Caustic if you want to do any stacked jungle camps.

                  safelane or mid, and showing up at fights is the first step

                  The skill build from this point onward is pretty self-explanatory,
                  as additional points in Sand Storm will give you somewhat respectable
                  added damage in fights but more important a nice, short cooldown escape.
                  With max Sand Storm and Octarine you can use that sucker to disjoint
                  projectiles every 7.5 seconds, making you one of the most elusive
                  heroes of this kind in the game (right behind Puck).

              Unless going for a large mana regen item like Bloodstone as your main
              core item, putting more than a single point in your Mystic Flare before
              you have enough mana can be bad. A simple rule of thumb I've adopted
              from playing Tinker is save level 2 until you have 1000 mana, and
              level 3 until you have 2000.

                  While the mechanics of this build don't differ much from the Lane
                  King build, being flexible with your first point in Sand Storm does
                  mean you also have the ability to jungle slightly earlier. Especially
                  as a mid-lane Skywrath Mage this can pay off if you're able to burst
                  down creep waves and then go stack for yourself, or have a support
                  to stack for you.

                  In the offlane or midlane you may find yourself getting ganked
                  even as early as level 1. Usually if you're 1v1 in the safelane
                  you can use your map awareness to detect any enemy rotations
                  coming your way, but in the midlane and offlane specifically
                  you're much more likely to be within range of an enemy support
                  rotation pre-level 4. Taking Sand Storm as early as level 2
                  will likely work out fine if you absolutely have to do it, but
                  your kill potential compared to the Lane King build is drastically
                  reduced if you are forced to compromise like this. With adequate
                  Observer Wards and missing calls you should be able to just back
                  off any time an enemy support goes missing (assuming they could kill
                  you of course), allowing you to safely just take Sand Storm a little
                  later such as at level 4.

                  When it comes to burst damage at level 3, 1-0-2 is definitely the
                  strongest you can get. 1-1-1 is a perfectly acceptable build though,
                  and works in practically any situation. Just keep in mind that
                  the extremely long cooldown of level 1 Sand Storm means that
                  a smart opponent will make you waste it before the actual gank
                  shows up, so you actually stand more to lose by taking Sand Storm
                  and wasting it than by simply holding a skill point until you
                  absolutely need it or simply investing in more harassment/farming

                  With 1-1-2 you become a somewhat reliable ganker and jungler

                  you're in the offlane and not enjoying yourself you can leave!
                  Go find a gank on the enemy mid (use a Smoke!) or hit up that
                  convenient new sidelane creep camp if you aren't getting much
                  in lane somehow (for example, you're up against a trilane).

                  At this point you want to return to your regularly scheduled
                  programming by maxing Burrowstrike. Level 5 with 2-1-2 is
                  nowhere near as strong as 3-0-2 or 2-0-3, but you'll find
                  that you can likely still harass your opponent out of lane
                  with a couple Burrow+Caustic combos. Especially if you're
                  offlaning against the enemy's hard carry, don't be afraid
                  to dump your remaining regen into some dangerous dives just
                  to disrupt their farm at this point, especially if you aren't
                  being bothered by the enemy supports enough to feel like you

                  Why would you want to skip Epicenter at level 6? Well, most of
                  the time it's because you aren't going to be able to kill anyone
                  with it anyway. As a rather long cooldown ultimate, however, the
                  usual school of thought is that you want to use it as many times
                  as you can throughout the game, so it's really up to you to decide
                  if a level 6 gank with Epicenter but no Blink is going to work.
                  If you do opt to skip it here, you're essentially committing to
                  staying in lane until you finish Blink and get level 8.

                <p>
                  The main reason to max Burrowstrike is that you really want
                  that maximum cast range, but the damage is nice too. With
                  4-1-2-0 at level 7 you offer close to the maximum burst damage
                  possible without using Epicenter, plus with your Sand Storm you
                  actually have a way to survive any gank you go for, but in general
                  this build is about static laning and flash-farming with some
                  degree of safety. If you somehow end up getting Blink at level 7,
                  before you get a skill point for Epicenter, you can still rotate
                  around looking for ganks, but it also may be worth considering
                  using your Level 1 Sand Storm and Caustic to jungle up one more
                  level quietly so as to not reveal your Blink before you have Epi.

                  It's pretty much always a good idea to pick up a Smoke of Deceit
                  to send out on the courier with your Blink Dagger. Your first rotation
                  is definitely the most important moment of the game for a Skywrath Mage,
                  as it will set the tempo for your farming for the next 10 minutes
                  and gives you an idea of what kind of itemization you want to go for.
                  If you find that the first gank fails because your opponents are tanky,
                  you may want to go straight into a Veil or Dagon. If you die because
                  of enemy support rotations, you may want a Force Staff or Eul's next.
                  If you succeed in killing 1 or 2 major targets and everything goes
                  according to plan, Boots of Travel are the next purchase because they
                  allow you to keep the pressure up AND find farm all over the map.

                  After your first rotation you might even already have reached
                  level 9 if you were successful, but either way you now most likely
                  want to return to the lane you came from and keep farming. If you
                  see easy pickoffs across the map or both teams are doing lots
                  of fighting you likely want to be there instead, but as a Core Sand
                  King keeping up your farm is what sets you apart from a support,
                  and you'll farm considerably faster in lane than in the jungle.
                  Just make sure to keep a vigilant eye on the mini-map at this point,
                  as the fact that your lanes will have most likely collapsed means
                  that supports and gankers will be roaming potentially anywhere and
                  everywhere looking for opportunities to kill oblivious heroes

                  and Roshan. One good tip here in general is that Skywrath Mage is even
                  better at counter-initiating than initiating, so when you're playing

                  plus you stand to deal an absolute truckload of damage with your
                  Epicenter. Always keep in mind that you can potentially sting
                  a few creeps with Caustic after you Blink in and before
                  Burrow-stunning if there are no BKBs or heroes with mobility/defensive
                  spells that you're trying to target. The slow from Epicenter
                  helps with this too, just make sure you don't let anyone get
                  away before Epicenter pulses explode those creeps for you!

                  The second point of Sand Storm and on are not really going to be
                  used for farming the jungle at this point so much as to allow you
                  to escape during teamfights and deal slightly more damage if you
                  get the chance to Sand Storm on top of your Epi. Ultimately the
                  damage from Sand Storm is slightly easier to get off in a teamfight
                  than that of Caustic, but you're much more likely to be able to
                  tap some creeps and casually catch enemy heroes with Caustic damage
                  in early game teamfights, which tend to be less chaotic and easier
                  to escape.

                      With Soul Ring plus Cold Embrace, Wyvern can farm and sustain

                      Blink can be an extremely key item for getting off those clutch Curses
                      and Cold Embraces—but in games where you aren't having trouble getting
                      off your spells or getting caught out, it can be preferable to continue
                      straight into more damage or utility items instead. Blink is never a
                      bad idea, however, especially if you can save your own life with it
                      even once by blinking out of a bad situation. Be sure to make the most
                      of your blink reveal by catching your enemies out with a big surprise
                      initiation.

                      be at every fight she can if you're bothering to make her
                      a core. For these reasons alone Boots of Travel are game
                      changers on Winter Wyvern, but especially in light of her
                      abilities as a flash-farmer and split-pusher. The 70-second
                      cooldown on Teleport Scroll just won't cut it if you're
                      going to put heavy pressure on the enemy as a Corevern.

                      Aether Lens is a fantastic item for anyone with initiation or
                      nuking duties, and Skywrath Mage is no exception—he has both.
                      The key is not to rely on it as an early core item, as 5% damage
                      and 200 range on 1, potentially 2 spells if you have Blink is <i>so</i>
                      not worth it. The item slot is the greatest cost associated here,
                      but the nice part is it's cheap enough that you can sell it without
                      much regret if you end up needing to itemize defensively or decide
                      to pick up more damage. Note that this logic explains why heroes with
                      4 targeted active abilities, like Lion or Bane or Shadow Shaman,
                      benefit so much from an early Aether Lens.

                      Picking up 1-2 extra Sage's Masks can really help with your early-game
                      mana management—plus they can be used to build several other useful
                      items (especially if you're going Orchid later). If your game starts to
                      look bad, going for some of these small, incremental items can help you
                      claw your way back into the game.

                      OoV's 4% ranged slow does, in fact, stack with that of Arctic Burn.
                      It may not sound like much, but the added harass and kiting-potential
                      is especially deadly against melee heroes 1v1, and also aids in
                      zoning out enemy supports when off-laning.

                      Orchid is the best intelligence and damage-dealing item Wyvern
                      can get, plus the silence effectively doubles her lockdown.
                      Threaten a gank with Orchid, then Winter's Curse everyone
                      when their friends show up to counter-initiate! Use Orchid to
                      force out an enemy BKB/Eul's/Manta, then lock them down with Curse!
                      The applications are endless. Especially good against any hero with
                      an escape.

                      This is it. Refresher is the single best item on Wyvern. Double
                      Winter's Curse is nearly guaranteed to win a teamfight on its own,
                      especially in games with farmed enemy physical damage cores. You
                      should default to Refresher AND turn to it when all else fails,
                      especially because it combos so well with other beneficial active
                      items like Blink, Sheepstick, BKB, etc. The huge amount of mana regen
                      it provides is yet another reason why Refresher is an attractive
                      early pickup on Wyvern—moreso than perhaps nearly any hero in
                      the game.

                  Blink can be an extremely key item for getting off those clutch Curses
                  and Cold Embraces—but in games where you aren't having trouble getting
                  off your spells or getting caught out, it can be preferable to continue
                  straight into more damage or utility items instead. Blink is never a
                  bad idea, however, especially if you can save your own life with it
                  even once by blinking out of a bad situation. Be sure to make the most
                  of your blink reveal by catching your enemies out with a big surprise
                  initiation.

                  Burrowstrike every 8.25s, this build absolutely maximizes the
                  potential teamfight control for our slippery sand friend.
                  It also provides the most mana of any build listed, with 2.3k
                  mana and ~13 mana regen at level 16, and 2.7k mana with ~18
                  mana regen at level 25. Feel free to improvise in your
                  matches, but I find this inverted buildup with Aether Lens
                  late to be very resilient, as in you are unlikely to need to
                  deviate, and smooth, as in you gain power steadily until
                  reaching 6-slots. Even past these six-slots you can itemize
                  further with Refresher Orb on a courier, or Ethereal Blade in
                  place of Aether Lens potentially, but as the charts below
                  show the real key to this build is initiation range and the
                  manapool/mana regen to keep it up in a late-game fight.

                  If you feel like blowing enemies up instead of turning them
                  into pigs, this is the build for you. Aether Lens on just
                  Ethereal Blade and Blink Dagger may not seem like much justification
                  for the item over a stronger alternative like Veil, but the
                  extra range on Eblade especially can make your late-game
                  skirmishing abilities seriously scary. Keep in mind that Sand
                  King's item builds are VERY flexible, and all of the builds
                  listed here are subject to experimentation. You can hybridize
                  the baseline build with defensive capabilities by adding a Eul's
                  or BKB instead of Aether Lens, for example. Just keep in mind what
                  order items are considered Core (as in you'll get them eventually),
                  and which are just a luxury (all the items listed under Situational
                  or Extension, although Aghanim's is definitely pretty Core too).

            <p id="lanes">
              Here are all of the recent professional Skywrath Mage LAN games,
              which (almost) all happen to be core SK picks:<br>

              MID

              This is what most of the guide is geared towards, but don't
              let that stop you from experimenting with our feathery friend
              in all sorts of lanes. Mid is probabably the most comfortable
              home for a Skywrath anyway, as he can perch up on the hill and
              successfully last-hit and harass away at anyone in the lane.
              Without adequate ward coverage (sentries for roaming BH/Riki,
              etc) you're dead to any kind of coordinated gank, but in most
              straight 1v1 match-ups you'll either win or seriously compromise
              the enemy mid's farm due to your annoying frickin spam.

              OFFLANE

              3-position Skywrath Mage is almost exclusively a dual-lane
              affair, but if you MUST or get stuck in a bad situation,
              don't let me stop you from solo-killing the enemy's solo
              safelane 1k MMR Anti-Mage with mana-break and no boots
              using Arcane Bolt. You do you. Just keep in mind that
              against any kind of organized dual- or tri-lane designed
              to kill, you're a gonner if you get caught out. Pick up
              those early Brown Boots and probably Wind Lace too. Be
              cheeky, cautious, and crafty about getting last-hits.
              Wards and quick fingers will keep you alive against
              anything except for a smoke-ganking Earthshaker, Lion,
              etc.
