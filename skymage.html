              <h4>Description</h4>
              <p>
                Sand King is a Strength hero with abilities that requires
                him to get close to enemies and attack them, but unlike
                a carry hero does not primarily deal damage by attacking
                during an engagement. Sand King's main role is to
                provide lockdown with his signature spell: Burrowstrike.
                It provides damage and mobility along with a hard stun,
                all in one package, supplemented by his other spells: Sand
                Storm to provide jungling ability and a second escape, his
                ultimate Epicenter to deal tons of magic damage, and his
                passive Caustic Finale, which allows Sand King to flash
                farm quicker than most heroes.
              </p>
              <h4>Lore</h4>
              <p>
                The sands of the Scintillant Waste are alive and sentient--the
                whole vast desert speaks to itself, thinking thoughts only such a
                vastness can conceive. But when it needs to find a form to
                communicate with those of more limited scope, it frees a fragment
                of itself, and fills a carapace of magic armor formed by the
                cunning Djinn of Qaldin. This essential identity calls itself
                Crixalis, meaning 'Soul of the Sand,' but others know it as Sand
                King.  Sand King takes the form of a huge arachnid, inspired by
                the Scintillant Waste's small but ubiquitous denizens; and this
                is a true outward expression of his ferocious nature.  Guardian,
                warrior, ambassador--Sand King is all of these things,
                inseparable from the endless desert that gave him life.

                Sand King is highly versatile with regards to which role and
                lane he goes, but he's still a hero you want to avoid picking
                early if you can because he's somewhat counterable. Consult
                the following list of hero interactions during your drafts for
                some idea of how each matchup works, but keep in mind that some
                categories on this list refer to 1v1 matchups while others
                are just general notes (hover over the section title for more info).

                      SK excels against these heroes, primarily in lane but
                      also when using his combo, because the extra enemy
                      minions allow CF to be procced multiple times, granting
                      extra damage and also some free CS.

                        Although Furion (Nature's Prophet) himself is pretty
                        squishy, the primary reason why he's weak to SK is his
                        Treants. These are the potentially most numerous summon,
                        sometimes in hordes due to the NP Aghanim's upgrade. As with
                        any hero in this category, either counter Prophet in lane
                        by following him if he tries to relocate permanently, or
                        potentially disrupt his jungle as a support SK by making
                        early rotations. Playing SK in these matchups is like playing
                        Earthshaker and using Echo Slam—if you see Furion surrounded
                        by his creeps, you can easily take him down—sometimes using
                        just Burrowstrike and a Caustic attack or two.

                        Enchantress is a walking oxymoron—her low health
                        means she is especially susceptible to magic burst like
                        Epicenter, BUT she's also perhaps the most resilient
                        jungler there is.  Enchantress is extremely difficult
                        to catch or kill during the early game because of her
                        high movement speed and Untouchable—thus it is not
                        recommended to attempt roaming against any competent
                        Enchantress player.  Instead, the best way to play this
                        matchup is as a core, in lane. An early level 6,
                        whether laning against Enchantress or not, since the
                        1v1 matchup isn't as particularly strong here for the
                        SK, means an early Epicenter, which means dead Bambi.
                        Early on Enchantress is especially susceptible to magic
                        burst since her Strength is the lowest in the game. As
                        a greedy jungler, SK can potentially punish Enchantress
                        by farming his team's jungle first, and then rotating
                        to counter-gank the offlane or roaming Enchantress, but
                        this style of play is definitely most risky against an
                        Enchantress compared to other junglers.

                        This is the #1 clearest situation to pick a Sand King.
                        Many tiny spiders means SK can farm up a storm, shut
                        down the weaker Arachnid in lane, and potentially
                        snowball out of control. The key is finding the lane
                        against Broodmother—and watch out for Web tricks!

                        normally lane, then guess which lane she would go to if
                        trying to avoid you. The answer may sometimes be mid or
                        your team's safelane! Whatever you do, REMEMBER the
                        ONLY reason to pick SK against Brood is the lane matchup.
                        If you treat the matchup this way you'll be much more
                        successful, as Sand King lineups tend
                        to run out of steam unless another core takes over
                        or the wombo-combo teamfight is unstoppable. Brood
                        will often simply beat out the SK's team unless you can
                        feed on her early game, snowballing into her team's
                        base and taking high ground by a somewhat reasonable
                        time (30:00-40:00 minutes).

                        Enigma is one of the easiest junglers to counter-jungle
                        because he's at his most fragile during the early game—before
                        he can pick up any Mekansm or other armor items,
                        and while his Eidolons are still weak. A boots-first
                        roaming SK can hope to find a pick-off roaming into the
                        Enigma's jungle early game, while a smart core SK can
                        carry an early TP scroll starting around 4 minutes and
                        usually TP to help any lane where Enigma ganks at level 6,
                        hopefully surprising Enigma and stopping Black Hole
                        prematurely. Once again, remember how useful Smoke can
                        be here, especially in pubs where most Smokes will go

                        Roaming support Sand King may be effective at shutting

                        overzealous Chen surrounded by his flock. Remember that
                        a 50g Smoke will make or break these rotations
                        generally—the enemy might have wards you know! As a
                        core SK, you should never have a problem escaping the
                        Chen when he ganks you, so long as you don't get

                        1v1, this lane is definitely a close contest for CS
                        until SK hits level 3, or maybe even level 2 if he gets
                        aggressive on Beastmaster under a creep wave
                        successfully—but the matchup tends to favor Sand King
                        overall because in late-game teamfights, he can always
                        afford to hang back and wait for the Beastmaster to go
                        in first. Hawk vision can definitely make life hard for
                        a clumsy SK caught in the trees, but always remember in
                        such situations that a little purple puff of some Smoke
                        of Deceit can make the whole play work for only 50g. If
                        you play AROUND the Beastmaster, he'll be the one
                        getting hunted.

                        didn't know. This allows Sand King and Caustic Finale,
                        especially with Aghanim's Scepter, can dominate and
                        potentially shut illusion heroes down before they even

                        killing them, but with Aghanim's allowing your

                        any enemy illusion, you can definitely do lots of
                        damage to these enemy heroes during the early- to

                        While most heroes will get wrecked in lane by the
                        potential Spirit Lance spam, Sand King excels in that
                        he can level Sand Storm early to dodge Lances. Making
                        this adjustment lowers your kill potential in the 1v1
                        lane at lower levels, but definitely increases your
                        survivability. Grabbing an Aghanim's before PL tanks up
                        means PL will fear you, perhaps relying on solely
                        pushing with illusions, so vision is always key to
                        these matchups.

                        CK is a scary opponent in lane, especially because he often
                        brings an IO or other support with him, but in a somewhat
                        fair 1v1 Sand King can definitely still manhandle this
                        tanky brute. Against a lane with supports, hang back and
                        level Sand Storm early enough to escape their aggression,
                        as it will also let you fall back to the jungle. With
                        a decent Aghanim's timing Sand King will usually destroy
                        the CK throughout the mid-to-late game, but after fully
                        tanking up CK may just be too strong for SK to take down
                        without items like Veil and Shiva's.

                        The old man does great things for Sand King when
                        they're on the same team—but as opponents Sand King
                        gets to enjoy feeding on him AND his horse, because
                        KotL is especially squishy and vulnerable to burst
                        damage, even with the Mek build.  A smart KotL player
                        might itemize Pipe of Insight to combat the SK, but
                        outside of this situation you'll find an enemy KotL as
                        mostly free food.

                        AA is also a wonderful hero to have on your team as an
                        SK, but as enemies you'll only really have to contend
                        with getting scouted out by Ice Vortex or maybe having

                        pretty much no way to stop you, so feel free to walk
                        up and give him a tap—just beware of the Cold Feet plus

                        SK is one of the best heroes at catching heroes with
                        escapes because Burrowstrike is practically instant,
                        catching these heroes out before they can use their
                        spells to escape. One important note is that SK can
                        basically replace Puck in many drafts because of this
                        capacity—although his stun is slightly shorter in
                        duration than Puck's Silence, Sand King offers more
                        magical damage.

                        Slark is a tough nut to crack once he hits level 6 and

                        but pre-6 especially Slark is not that difficult
                        to lane against, plus the passive nature of Caustic
                        makes it uneconomical for Slark to use his Dark Pact
                        on Caustic should you find yourself able to harass
                        him with it. Stunning this little fish down and
                        bursting him at level 5 should be pretty darned easy,
                        plus even in the late-game you should be quick
                        enough to catch a Slark player with Blink into Burrow
                        before he can Dark Pact. Consider Blinking on top of

                        you're having trouble catching one in your game.

                        Weaver is so squishy that you will nearly always be

                        a good situation where the aggressive item build can be

                        short-ranged once again, making him weak to Caustic and
                        proving for a second time that Crixalis is the king

                        Burrowstrike is not a long enough duration stun to
                        catch out and kill a hero like Storm Spirit with SO
                        much mobility—but you can be the one fast enough to
                        catch him, even with just Burrowstrike. Getting an
                        additional Eul's Scepter or Scythe of Vyse means you
                        can instantly Cyclone or Sheep, channel Epicenter, and
                        chain into your own stun. In lane, remember that Storm
                        Spirit is short-ranged, and thus is quite susceptible
                        to Caustic harass—especially when he goes in for a
                        Remnant.

                        Queen of Pain is not necessarily squishy per se, but she

                        catch her out with his 2000 speed projectile. Her high
                        burst AoE damage may at some point be used to try and
                        coerce you into leaving Sand Storm, so keep in mind
                        that against heroes like QoP you must always keep an eye
                        on your health to make sure you're not making a suicidal
                        Burrow stun into the center of a teamfight. Sometimes
                        with Aghs this play can work out, since you'll also have
                        Caustic damage to play with without exposing yourself to
                        any small arms fire while you sting people, but playing
                        against magic burst heroes like QoP requires discipline
                        that even some pro Sand King players lack. Don't throw
                        your life away unless it's to actually FINISH OFF the

                        the active death Finale burst once for Meepo this matchup
                        is not quite as favorable as the illusion-based heroes.

                        1v1 or even 1v2 without a strong zoning support. Meepo
                        may still try to Earthbind and Poof you down once he hits
                        level 4-5, but this is an easy enough situation to escape
                        if you save Burrowstrike or simply don't let him bind you

                        While not covered under the Weaver section, let it be said
                        here that Linken's Sphere carries like Weaver and Morphling
                        can be quite annoying for a core SK because Linken's will
                        always block Burrowstrike, even if it's not hero-targeted.
                        Bearing this in mind, it may be prudent to pick-up an
                        additional active item like Eul's against these heroes, IF
                        they go Linken's Sphere, to quickly pop their Linken's and
                        follow-through with your Burrow combo. Morphling can be

                        him, but even in these cases Sand King has the advantage
                        with a lower cooldown mobility spell and Caustic slow, so
                        long as the Morphling doesn't instantly replicate out.
                        Morphling is also low-range enough to be hit will Caustic
                        while going in for last hits himself, so for all intents
                        and purposes you can treat the Morphling 1v1 matchup as
                        favorably as you would the matchup with a melee hero.

                        lie in wait in some patch of trees for the Tinker to come
                        along. Since Tinker players tend to get an Ethereal Blade
                        of their own, late-game Tinker can be especially helpless
                        against a wise Sand King player's ganks, that is unless
                        the Tinker is forced to go BKB or Linken's. Either way
                        lane matchups against a Tinker 1v1 are not that unfavorable,
                        just watch for the Lasers right as you go for last-hits.
                        These plays are opportunities for you to dive in with Burrow
                        if you already have Caustic on a creep or two and aren't
                        too low on health, but consider avoiding the 1v1 altogether
                        if there's a more suitable ranged laner on your team.

                        Puck is probably tied for the hardest on this list to

                        Burrow's spike projectile, especially if they know you're
                        coming. Plan on counter-initiating on the Puck rather
                        than trying to catch him—and in lane, avoid this 1v1
                        matchup unless you know you'll have support rotations

                      Sven is one of the classic melee heroes that Sand King
                      crushes in lane, forcing him to back away from the creeps
                      or risk taking Caustic harassment and Burrow burst damage.
                      You may end up wanting a Eul's/Eblade/Shiva's Guard to
                      mitigate Sven's extreme physical damage later in the game,
                      but hopefully if you get this lane 1v1, or even 1v2 with
                      some weak support, you can likely snowball off the lane
                      while simultaneously denying Sven tons of farm.

                      Dragon Knight is definitely one of the toughest heroes to kill
                      1v1 thanks to his large health pool, health regeneration,
                      and instant stun to disengage with, but you should always
                      keep in mind that the armor from DK's passive and the damage
                      reduction from his Breathe Fire have NO effect on your magic
                      damage. Early in the game this means the lane is easily a kill
                      lane for the SK, although DK should be able to last hit somewhat
                      safely and harass you back some. Late-game if the DK starts
                      to really tank up with a Pipe or BKB things can get rocky,
                      but hopefully if you end up in this 1v1 you won't let him
                      get that far along, or you'll punish him by running down
                      his charges and keeping up the pace by pushing out waves
                      and teamfighting constantly with the Octarine build.

                      This has got to be one of the very easiest lanes for
                      Sand King to CS in and kill, but Slardar does have
                      plenty of counterplay potential of his own making this
                      nowhere near the safest 1v1 matchup. Slardar's Crush
                      means he can stun you out of Sand Storm (plus see you
                      during it with his ultimate), and Sprint lets him
                      chase YOU down if you choose to run (if you have Blink
                      and he doesn't you'll get away, but if you both do
                      Slardar can pretty much always catch you, which is rare
                      for Sand King). Either way, the bonus damage Slardar
                      takes from Sprint does mean that he's an easy enough
                      hero to burst down later on in the game, just be aware
                      of any BKB or Pipe of Insight pickups that would throw

                      Alchemist definitely seems like a an underutilized hero
                      these days, but 1v1 against a Sand King he will just look
                      silly. Picking up a couple Mangos, as prescribed here, to
                      counteract the tick damage from Acid Spray is the only real
                      adjustment you'll need to make against Alchemist, though as
                      always if you can get his rune at minute 0 he'll be somewhat
                      crippled (temporarily). Later on in the game Alchemist
                      can become quite tanky and hard to burst down, not to mention
                      if he goes Radiance that can interfere with your Blink Dagger,
                      but this give you all the more reason to go for either
                      control in the form of a Scythe of Vyse to catch out a tanky
                      Alchemist, or more burst damage in the form of Dagon/Eblade to
                      punish an Alch for not tanking up enough.

                      from the newly buffed Reactive Armor may not

                      PA is a bit harder than most to shut down completely since

                      and slow enough to kill 1v1. A Sand King pick would surely
                      be enough to force PA into an early BKB, but if not you can
                      literally just keep solo-killing her over and over with
                      Epicenter (although do be mindful of baits if you're playing

                      be the one doing the Blinking onto him, rather than the other

                      early as a setup for some nuker, and combine SK with
                      one or two meta picks.

                      While the obvious synergy here is simply Repel to allow
                      Sand King to skip BKB himself, the same could be said about
                      literally any other core hero that's item slot limitted.
                      In this case Omni makes a great partner for Sand King because
                      he always puts his body into the middle of the fight, and
                      tossing out that Purify onto a Burrow and/or Epicenter
                      is often all you need to take down a tanky opponent as the
                      Sand King. Finding a laning situation to make use of this
                      combo is definitely a challenge, but the best is actually
                      just a dual offlane against some melee carry and weaker
                      support, for example Spectre/Dazzle or Sven/Lion. 2v2,
                      SK and Omni are nearly as deadly of a duo as Omni and Tusk.

                      Elder Titan is seeing something of a resurgance this patch,

                      the strongest tool of its kind for nuking down clumps of enemies,
                      and you can imagine how strong the wombo from a lineup
                      with 2-3 of these heroes to buff up SK can be. The Elder
                      Titan Echo Stomp into Burrow+Epicenter is much easier to
                      pull off than Titan's own Earth Splitter combo, and is rivaled
                      only by Naga Siren for its ability to set up a perfect Epi.

                      As a teammate, Ancient Apparition is one of the best
                      magic damage amplification heroes there is. His ultimate
                      lets you instagib crowds of enemies, with enough coordination,
                      while Ice Vortex is the perfect accompaniment for your
                      casual Blink+Burrow amplification needs. Best of all,
                      now that Cold Feet has received several direct buffs in a
                      row you can now reasonably max it first while laning with
                      a partner like Sand King, as you can spam it and zone
                      your enemies with the threat of a followup Burrow once
                      the Cold Feet cooldown gets low enough (down to 7s at
                      level 4!). AA is also a great candidate for an early
                      Veil, which is something SK loves from his supports.

                      This is my personal favorite combo with SK, not really because
                      of the mana from Chakra but from the cooldown reduction.
                      Casting Chakra on SK while he's channeling Epicenter allows
                      the SK to perform a near-double Burrowstrike, down to a 5
                      second cooldown or 3 with Octarine. The Octarine+Chakra
                      double Burrow gives Sand King 4.34 seconds of lockdown with a
                      ~1 second gap after the first stun duration ends, before
                      you can cast the second one. Recall and Blinding Light
                      can both also be useful for a KotL to help out his Sand King,
                      to rejoin a push across the map before BoTs or to knock
                      escaping enemies back into your Epicenter.

                      Undying is a bit of an awkward hero to lane on the same team

                      in such situations, your best bet may be to put Sand King solo
                      safelane while offensive tri-laning with the Undying, who can
                      not only make short work of the enemy's three heroes with his
                      Tombstone Zombies, but also later on will amplify up his opponents
                      with his ultimate, Flesh Golem, so that when Sand King eventually
                      rotates for a gank he can deal even more damage.

                      Bloodseeker is perhaps the most underutilized damage buffing hero
                      on this list, and is also one who has great synergy with Sand King.
                      Since you'll like go into Sand Storm or scoot out with a Force Staff
                      after getting off your Epicenter during the fight, Sand King is
                      actually a fairly safe hero to just cast Blood Rage on directly,
                      allowing him to potentially heal up from any creeps or heroes he
                      finishes off with Epicenter and Burrow when he goes in. The real
                      question here is how to lane Bloodseeker and Sand King on the same
                      team—all I have here is theories, but I'd say that putting
                      Bloodseeker either in the jungle or as another core can both work.

                      As mobility tools for Sand King, heroes like Tusk, Tiny
                      and IO provide loads of utility—but keep in mind that
                      all three of these modes of transportation cancel Epicenter
                      channeling. The other heroes in this category offer unique
                      synergy to be used in combination with blinking, ganking

                      This is one of the most fun lane combos there is—Snowball
                      into Burrowstrike is a nearly guaranteed catch (blinking
                      heroes can probably escape, or a self-banish like Puck),
                      and the amount of damage these two hefty brawlers put out
                      during the combined stun durations will nearly always result
                      in a kill the first few times you use it. Later on, the potency
                      of this combo falls off because you can't Snowball while
                      channeling Epicenter (it cancels Epi), so you should mostly
                      rely on the lane combination of these two heroes (likely
                      in your offlane) to snowball and win the game.

                      This one is probably less obvious, but Burrowstrike is
                      the perfect duration for Invoker to get a Sun Strike off,
                      allowing your potentially mid Invoker to participate in
                      kills in his own safe or off-lane starting pretty early on.
                      Later on, the potential of a long-range Tornado catch into
                      Epicenter blink combo is really devestating in sloppy
                      jungle fights and skirmishes, making this a scrappy combo
                      of heroes apt for early game rotations. Even as a support
                      SK can make this combo work pretty effectively.

                      Simple enough—Burrow into Arrow makes a pretty good hit and run

                      able to gank as a team, or just as a duo, very effectively.
                      The laning possiblities between these two heroes are so
                      open that you can also safely pick them together early,
                      so long as you're able to flip them both to a support

                      This craggy guy makes an excellent teammate because

                      is rather hard to fit both Tiny and Sand King on the
                      same team. Some teams have experimented with some
                      weird offlane or support Tinys, but really I think
                      the best way to make these heroes work together is
                      something like a mid Tiny+IO, or a safelane Tiny.
                      Keep in mind once again though that Tossing your
                      teammate Sand King will cancel Epicenter channeling,
                      so wait until he's done if you want to try for that.

                      a great setup slow for Sand King to catch out enemies
                      at low levels, especially at level 1 when roaming
                      into your enemy's jungle as 5. Once Skywrath hits level
                      6, the ability to drop Mystic Flare on top of a casual
                      Blink+Burrow turns this ganking duo into a seriously
                      scary one-two punch.

                      Again the first thing to note here is that Relocating
                      while Sand King is channeling Epicenter will result in a
                      canceled ult, BUT the ability to Relocate stun anyone
                      on the map, plus all the bonus movement speed and damage
                      reduction from Tether to help keep Sand King alive, makes
                      this combo a fairly potent one well into the mid-game. The
                      best part about it is that you don't need to lane them
                      together, and can utilize Sand King's naturally strong laning
                      capabilities to afford IO's lane support to a more important
                      hero like your team's hard carry.

                    Losing one teamfight can mean a long period of crippled
                    engagements while waiting for cooldowns to come back up.

                    Miss someone with your Burrow? Catch them before they scurry

                    with ANY teamfight ultimate, and Sand King is no exception.
                    The ability to clean up enemies with huge Epicenters, plus
                    elevate a simple Burrow into a ravage on the whole other team,

                    often something your enemies won't expect but which can happen

                    As a teammate, Tidehunter makes one of the best setups
                    for your Epicenter channeling, since if you time it right
                    the enemies will be stationary as you line up the perfect
                    Burrowstrike to chain after the Ravage. Offlane Tidehunter
                    and safelane SK is a fairly flat combo that can be punished
                    if you reveal it too early in the draft, so try to hide at
                    least one of these picks until 5th (as with most of the

                    Enigma is a significantly faster jungler than Sand King,
                    plus he's the perfect hero to grab an early Mek instead
                    of a Blink, allowing your team to push and group up earlier
                    and allowing SK to do the initiating. While this combo is
                    somewhat punishable in the draft, you may be able to actually
                    throw your opponent off by picking these two ambiguous heroes
                    early and laning them in a unique configuration, or if your
                    enemy overreacts and plays a style they're not comfortable
                    with. Opponents will definitely be scared if they see Enigma
                    and SK early during the draft, so you should at least be
                    aware of this before you grab them together.

                    A long-range AoE initiator like Warlock is the perfect setup
                    for your majesty's carefully crafted Epicenter. Warlock is

                    enemy if your core SK gets an unfavorable lane matchup, but
                    even as a core Warlock makes a good companion for Sand King.
                    The utter devestation of Fatal Bonds into Epicenter is enough
                    to make an entire team crumble on its own.

                    As teammates, SK and Faceless really make a powerful duo—Epicenter
                    can deal its damage even if you blink into the Chronosphere,
                    allowing you to potentially followup with a Burrow stun while
                    your enemies are Time Dilated. Other than Zeus and Skywrath there
                    are few magic damage dealers that pair as well with Void as SK
                    does, although having them both on the same team implies that one
                    of them will most likely be safelane. If you can run a support
                    Sand King that also works especially well here, as the new FV
                    really enjoys finding his farm early and may need to rotate around
                    to find a decent lane. SK has the same finicky needs as a core and
                    so may not make the most reliable partner to grab early in a draft.

                    Phoenix is a fun combo to run with Sand King, but their synergy
                    is a bit difficult to take advantage of. The most common play
                    by far will be Sand King blinking in to Burrow stun an enemy that's
                    trying to take down the Supernova, but more effectively you would
                    combine SK and Phoenix with someone like a Treant to ensure that
                    the Phoenix ult goes off first, then put the Epicenter damage
                    on top of the the Supernova stun to let SK do the cleanup. A
                    support Phoenix or even an offlane one with a mid or safelane
                    SK can really result in powerful earlygame teamfights for you,
                    assuming that your lanes go as you would hope. If they don't,
                    that's where some strong support picks come in, to reassure these
                    more utilitarian cores don't falter against a snowballing enemy
                    team with potential hard-er carries.

                    or Epi. Picking the Rubick as a team looking to grab SK also

                    While much less straightforward to execute than the other
                    lane combos mentioned in this section, this is a classic
                    one that works best when the Sand King is the one initiating.
                    As either a support roamer or just a lane partner doing some
                    sneaking around, try popping out from behind some trees as
                    SK and Burrow stunning your lane opponents, allowing Lina
                    the time to follow up with her LSA. The extreme amount of
                    magic burst betweeen these two should be able to level all
                    but the absolute tankiest opponents (BKBs can be a problem
                    too obviously). Picking this much magic damage, especially
                    early on in the draft, can leave your team open to being
                    countered, so be prepared to be creative with your laning
                    to salvage your early game if you do.

                    Sven's Storm Hammer is simply one of the best stuns to follow
                    up on. Not only is it easy to hit, but it does enough damage
                    to soften weaker enemies up for a potential Caustic Finale,
                    maybe adding enough damage to turn a difficult gank into an easy
                    one. Sven's Cleave allows him to make short work of Burrow-stunned
                    targets later on, so consider pairing the two with another
                    synergistic hero like Dark Seer to really emphasize your combo's

                    fact that you're probably destroying the enemy on experience
                    with a Lich on your team—especially if he's in your lane as an SK.
                    Lich would be a fairly decent candidate to get an early Veil to
                    support his SK as well, although this is certainly not a common

                    thanks to the heals and Shallow Grave to keep things from going
                    South too quickly, and which will often be underestimated,
                    leading to a kill. The slow from Poison Touch could be nice,
                    but the Shallow Grave to save your Sand King diving under tower
                    is just too strong to pass up. Toss out that Shadow Wave heal
                    after SK goes diving in to proc caustic on a wave of creeps,
                    and practically anyone will go down (even a 10 armor Terrorblade).

                    but the chaos caused by his respawning and potentially silly
                    Aghanim's upgrade can make him a formidable teammate for SK
                    as well as a decent lane partner. Jungling your SK and then
                    roaming to the Wraith King's lane can work, as well as
                    farming the SK and having a roaming WK to stun into the lane,
                    probably from Smoke.

                    Venge can use Magic Missile to set up for Burrowstrike.
                    That's about the extent of the synergy, besides swap
                    saving the Sand King or swapping an enemy into Epicenter,
                    but that means that like the other heroes on this list
                    Venge makes a good support (and rarely carry) to pair with
                    Sand King when it comes to Captain's Mode. The lack of
                    any strong synergy means this is a combo you would probably
                    roam them together early and then turn SK into a static
                    jungler or laner, because neither one of these heroes
                    can carry on their own or together, and thus they cannot
                    afford to both be cores on the same team.

                    They make a decent roaming support duo or lane partners,
                    but do keep in mind that their synergy starts to really
                    fall apart after the early-mid game when teamfights start
                    to become messier. It's hard to use Disruption to set up
                    for an Epicenter unless you're getting clean initiations,
                    so potentially save this combo for a late-draft pocket
                    pick.

                    Also useful as a counter to Sand King with his Coco's Rum,
                    Kunkka is a stellar combo hero with Sand King, especially
                    together in a dual- or tri-lane getting kills. X-Marks is
                    an incredible ability to catch opponents out, so a support
                    Kunkka maxing it first can make your team's Sand King's
                    life incredibly easy. X-Marks into Burrow and/or Torrent
                    is already ~4 seconds of disable, and of course that all
                    that Kunkka AoE damage can be used to proc Caustic. Later
                    on in the game, the wombo-combo of a simple Boat plus
                    Torrent onto a Burrow+Epi is enough to win the fight on

                      Zeus is the most obvious counter to Sand King there is, as you

                    There are the heroes that either completely or partially
                    resist magic, and some of them can also give that buff
                    to their allies. In general when these opponents are on
                    the enemy team you should only pick Sand King for his
                    stunning abilities, not his damage, but depending on
                    the matchup, sometimes these counters are more impactful
                    than others (depending on the timings and goals of your

                    Repel may be great for you with an Omni on your team, but on the

                    Rubick, along with the several other heroes listed below, can
                    on very rare occasions ruin your Epicenter initiaton by snatching
                    you (or in some of the cases below, hexing or silencing you) instantly,
                    before you can even get the Burrowstrike off but after blinking in.
                    These kinds of superhuman feats are actually performed by simple
                    shift-queuing of commands usually, but still you must be wary
                    of these outplay potentials, as well as the potential for Rubick
                    to nab one of your spells. None of them is one you particularly
                    want to give Rubick, but Sand Storm is most definitely the one
                    you're most okay handing over, so always try to use that after
                    your initiations if you don't catch Rubick himself. All of
                    this discussion and we have to of course mention Rubick's aura,
                    which is actually perhaps the number one reason why Rubick sucks
                    to play against as SK. Being that level 1 Null Field was recently
                    buffed to 10% magic resistance, you certainly want to control
                    the Rubick pick after you've grabbed Sand King, if you can.

                    It should be pretty plain to see, but Rage is stupidly
                    good way for a melee carry like Lifestealer to avoid
                    all of your Epicenter damage, and potentially even the
                    Burrow stun if you aren't on point with your shift-queuing.
                    In lane the SK should actually dominate a 1v1 matchup with
                    Lifestealer where CS is concerned, but you'll have far less
                    kill potential than against other melee laners and be in
                    some danger should the Lifestealer get support rotations.
                    A good Lifestealer player won't be afraid to dive you early
                    on, thanks to his Rage.

                    Ember is definitely a slippery split pusher capable of
                    getting caught by your average SK player, BUT thanks to
                    Flame Guard you'll nearly always find the solo-kill much
                    harder than other similar heroes. If Ember for some reason
                    doesn't have the Flame Guard up, and/or you get an aggressive
                    burst item like Dagon, you can definitely pick off the
                    otherwise somewhat fragile Ember Spirit. Sand King does
                    have the choice of picking up a Eul's to dispel his Flame
                    Guard, but this combo may simply fail if the Ember has
                    a remnant up that he can leap out to. Not to mention
                    Ember can also respond to you with Linken's or BKB to
                    try and stop your initiations, or even Skadi to tank
                    through them instead.

                    Pudge is just an annoying hero overall, but his innate

                    long game where you may be struggling to pump out enough
                    damage is disturbing. As a Sand King, I would really LOVE
                    to avoid playing against Pudges altogether, but the 1v1
                    lane matchup really shouldn't be that bad. Avoid getting
                    hooked out of Sand Storm or caught out by some kind of
                    surprise magic resistance and you'll be fine. Later on,
                    after Pudge has something like a Blink, you'll have to be
                    clever and also control the other team's vision to maintain
                    the advantage in this matchup during chaotic mid-game

                    either going to need a way to catch out the Oracle reliably,
                    like a vision advantage, or you'll want to avoid picking
                    magic burst like Sand King.

                    Huskar is pretty hard for anyone using mostly magic
                    damage to burst down, but Sand King does have the advantage
                    of being able to escape from most sticky situations if Huskar
                    starts to get Burning Spear stacks on you. Avoid wasting your

                    have to kill Huskar with magic damage then a source of Break
                    would be nice (an ally with Silver Edge is the best choice,

                    While a Sand King is quite ideal for hunting down and catching
                    the Anti-Mage, with even one point in his Spell Shield you'll
                    find that Anti-Mage is quite an annoying target to take down.
                    For this reason I still don't recommend this matchup if you
                    can avoid it, even though Sand King can be great at catching
                    out a ratting AM. At the end of the day it comes down to your
                    confidence that the Sand King will snowball off of heroes
                    besides the Anti-Mage. The 1v1 matchup between the two is easy
                    to get last-hits but potentially dangerous due to AM's mana-drain
                    the fact that he has an escape to bait you with, plus Anti-Mage
                    often gets help from his supports.

                    1v1 matchups like the ones listed here. These are the
                    kind of 1v1 matchups you want to avoid if at all possible,
                    although some of them may be winnable with enough regen
                    and defensive itemization (Stout Shield at least). This
                    list is not exhaustive by any means though, so beware
                    of just about any ranged hero not listed anywhere here.

                    Clinkz is highly frustrating as the Sand King because
                    you won't be able to burst him down before he goes invis
                    and escapes—most likely. Even if you play this matchup
                    cautiously it's unlikely you'll be able to stop the Clinkz
                    from out-CSing you, and you'll likely take loads of free
                    orb harass from the Clinkz too.

                    Drow is annoying to lane against especially because of
                    the threat her silence Gust provides. It can knock you
                    out of Sand Storm for one thing, but the possibility
                    of a quick and unexpected Gust forcing you to Burrow
                    away before you even know whether there's follow-up
                    is a very real and present threat, even 1v1. You
                    do not want to get silenced especially early on in the
                    game before you get up an item like Blink, Force, BKB or
                    Eul's that might let you escape these situations.

                    also Necrophos's tendency to tank up, build defensive items
                    like Mek/Pipe, and ability to catch you out with his ult.
                    His ranged harassment and overall lane presence makes him
                    one of the worst heroes to 1v1 mid or in a side-lane.

                    Viper is definitely a target you'll struggle to focus down
                    as Sand King—thanks largely to the magic resistance from
                    Viper's Corrosive Skin—but there are always moments when
                    you'll be able to catch the immobile Viper out. This is a
                    very difficult 1v1 matchup for any melee hero like SK, and
                    mid-lane especially you'll find it's better suited to a
                    ranged playmaker like Puck.

                    BUT you can always kill them if you somehow catch them. Avoiding
                    the 1v1 matchup here is once again probably a good idea,
                    although some kind of 2v1 shenanigans like Tiny+SK here could be
                    great fun to feed on a glass cannon like Sniper.

                    that his Static Link and general strong lane presence
                    would make him one of the best lane counters to SK there is.
                    Your only real hope against Razor is to hope his supports

            <h3>One King, Many Builds</h3>
            <p style="margin: 4px 0 8px 0;">
              All these builds are some variant of 4-2-4-2. What matters is
              what order you get those skills in. In general, always max
              Burrowstrike first and Caustic Finale second.

            <h4>Lane King</h4>
            <p>
              For free farm lanes where you most likely won't be ganked, and
              won't need to jungle or escape a gank early on, this build provides
              the best combination of lane presence, gank potential and safety.
              Skipping Sand Storm at level 8 and taking Caustic over Burrowstrike
              would provide more damage at levels 5-9, but you're only able to
              utilize that bonus Caustic damage situationally.

                <p>
                  This is the most aggressive skill build, foregoing early points
                  in Sand Storm to focus on winning the lane, so naturally at
                  level 1 you should abuse your Stout and/or Quelling Blade to
                  to get off Caustic harass on your opponent. If for some reason
                  you're not in a 1v1 lane, keep in mind that you can always
                  do small camps with level 1 Caustic, but this only benefits
                  you if you're in your own safelane of course.

                  Once you have both Burrow and Caustic, you're a kill threat.
                  Generally at level 2 you'll only be able to kill a very inexperienced
                  opponent, but with support gank rotations you can possibly pick
                  off your lane opponent (a hero like Witch Doctor, Skywrath, etc
                  makes a good gank partner, someone with damage and CC). At this
                  point you should only use Burrow for damage on your opponent,
                  not to farm, unless of course you're mid and looking to push
                  the wave before going for a rune. Your damage spike at level
                  3 means you'll want to save your mana for then.

                  Unlike the build in the chart above, which shows Q-E-Q, I would

                  kill potential. The lower cost of level 1 Burrowstrike, plus
                  the higher max burst damage of Level 2 Caustic over Level 2 Burrow
                  (if you look at the chart above carefully, you'll see that Caustic
                  provides more absolute damage since you can proc it on a whole creep
                  wave).

                  For max kill potential once you start looking for ganks, take
                  Burrow at levels 4, 5 and 7. It gives you the most range early on
                  in the game, which is usually the factor holding back your kills—

                  Level 5 is one of your peaks against your lane partner, as you'll

                  you've been slowly taking over. By this point you can clear a
                  creep wave and most medium jungle camps with Burrow and one or two
                  Caustic procs. If you can get this off on your opponent once or twice,

                <p>
                  Not every build here recommends Epicenter at level 6, and that's
                  because without a Blink Dagger you'll always have a hard time using
                  it. The best way to use an Epicenter without Blink is NOT to clear
                  stacks, no no you must set a trap. Hide in trees (use that Quelling
                  Blade!), wait for someone squishy to walk by (you deal ~600 damage
                  plus any Caustic procs you can find, after reductions), then Epi
                  in the trees and Burrow out onto them. This move only works in
                  the early game before people have mobility or defensive items, so
                  take advantage if you can. The combined slows from Caustic and Epi
                  can make even a fast hero significantly slowed as they escape, just
                  avoid using this combo on a Blink hero like Anti-Mage or QoP unless
                  you brought some stun-lock.

                  With max Burrow you can safely roam looking for pick-offs, but
                  more likely you'll be getting close to Blink Dagger money at this
                  point, and if so you'll want to find an empty lane and farm away.
                  Obviously if you had points in Sand Storm you could alternatively
                  jungle, but keep in mind that this point of this particular build
                  is to be in a lane, getting all the last hits and zoning out any
                  enemies who are dumb enough to stand near you. You're the KING
                  of this lane, so make sure that all other 9 players know it.

                  What's this? A point in SAND STORM? Why would we want that? Well
                  if you haven't deviated from this lunatic guide yet then I might
                  as well give you an explanation: it's to escape. At this point,
                  level 8, you should almost certainly be getting your Blink, and
                  now is the moment when you'll need Sand Storm not as a jungling
                  tool but as an escape. After you Blink deep into the enemy team
                  a time or two without Sand Storm, you'll stop going 4-0-4-1 or
                  whatever it was Moo did one DC game recently. The extra damage
                  from Caustic is amazing, and costs no mana, but you do need
                  Sand Storm by around the time you have Blink.

                  More Caustic means both faster jungling and more kill potential,
                  so snap it up. Lane creeps are easy to blow up with one Burrow
                  at this point, but the magic resistance and higher health pools
                  of jungle creeps means it's way more efficient to utilize just
                  W and E when jungling, if you decide to. With one point in Sand
                  Storm you can certainly do any camp or stack you want to, but
                  you'll have to stand there and take some damage while you apply
                  Caustic if you want to do any stacked jungle camps.

                  At level 10 you're nearing your absolute peak power, so feel
                  free to be aggressive. If you're following this item build closely
                  you'll also be getting Boots of Travel in here somewhere, giving
                  you unparalleled map mobility and the ability to show up at
                  every fight. Hint: you should. Sand King as a core hero is an
                  investment that has to pay off for his team, especially if it's
                  safelane or mid, and showing up at fights is the first step
                  to that.

                  Level 2 Epicenter isn't a huge boost in damage over level 1, but it
                  is noticeable enough and it comes just as you max out Caustic Finale
                  as well, giving you your peak magical damage relative to most other
                  cores. This is when you and your teammates want to group up, look
                  for objectives like tier 2 towers and Roshan, and look to take
                  control of the map using Epi to outright win key fights.

                  The skill build from this point onward is pretty self-explanatory,
                  as additional points in Sand Storm will give you somewhat respectable
                  added damage in fights but more important a nice, short cooldown escape.
                  With max Sand Storm and Octarine you can use that sucker to disjoint
                  projectiles every 7.5 seconds, making you one of the most elusive
                  heroes of this kind in the game (right behind Puck).

                  While the mechanics of this build don't differ much from the Lane
                  King build, being flexible with your first point in Sand Storm does
                  mean you also have the ability to jungle slightly earlier. Especially
                  as a mid-lane Sand King this can pay off if you're able to burst
                  down creep waves and then go stack for yourself, or have a support
                  to stack for you.

                  In the offlane or midlane you may find yourself getting ganked
                  even as early as level 1. Usually if you're 1v1 in the safelane
                  you can use your map awareness to detect any enemy rotations
                  coming your way, but in the midlane and offlane specifically
                  you're much more likely to be within range of an enemy support
                  rotation pre-level 4. Taking Sand Storm as early as level 2
                  will likely work out fine if you absolutely have to do it, but
                  your kill potential compared to the Lane King build is drastically
                  reduced if you are forced to compromise like this. With adequate
                  Observer Wards and missing calls you should be able to just back
                  off any time an enemy support goes missing (assuming they could kill
                  you of course), allowing you to safely just take Sand Storm a little
                  later such as at level 4.

                  When it comes to burst damage at level 3, 1-0-2 is definitely the
                  strongest you can get. 1-1-1 is a perfectly acceptable build though,
                  and works in practically any situation. Just keep in mind that
                  the extremely long cooldown of level 1 Sand Storm means that
                  a smart opponent will make you waste it before the actual gank
                  shows up, so you actually stand more to lose by taking Sand Storm
                  and wasting it than by simply holding a skill point until you
                  absolutely need it or simply investing in more harassment/farming
                  with Caustic.

                  With 1-1-2 you become a somewhat reliable ganker and jungler
                  besides your ability to lane aggressively, which means that if
                  you're in the offlane and not enjoying yourself you can leave!
                  Go find a gank on the enemy mid (use a Smoke!) or hit up that
                  convenient new sidelane creep camp if you aren't getting much
                  in lane somehow (for example, you're up against a trilane).

                  At this point you want to return to your regularly scheduled
                  programming by maxing Burrowstrike. Level 5 with 2-1-2 is
                  nowhere near as strong as 3-0-2 or 2-0-3, but you'll find
                  that you can likely still harass your opponent out of lane
                  with a couple Burrow+Caustic combos. Especially if you're
                  offlaning against the enemy's hard carry, don't be afraid
                  to dump your remaining regen into some dangerous dives just
                  to disrupt their farm at this point, especially if you aren't
                  being bothered by the enemy supports enough to feel like you
                  need to save that Sand Storm cooldown.

                  Why would you want to skip Epicenter at level 6? Well, most of
                  the time it's because you aren't going to be able to kill anyone
                  with it anyway. As a rather long cooldown ultimate, however, the
                  usual school of thought is that you want to use it as many times
                  as you can throughout the game, so it's really up to you to decide
                  if a level 6 gank with Epicenter but no Blink is going to work.
                  If you do opt to skip it here, you're essentially committing to
                  staying in lane until you finish Blink and get level 8.

                <p>
                  The main reason to max Burrowstrike is that you really want
                  that maximum cast range, but the damage is nice too. With
                  4-1-2-0 at level 7 you offer close to the maximum burst damage
                  possible without using Epicenter, plus with your Sand Storm you
                  actually have a way to survive any gank you go for, but in general
                  this build is about static laning and flash-farming with some
                  degree of safety. If you somehow end up getting Blink at level 7,
                  before you get a skill point for Epicenter, you can still rotate
                  around looking for ganks, but it also may be worth considering
                  using your Level 1 Sand Storm and Caustic to jungle up one more
                  level quietly so as to not reveal your Blink before you have Epi.

                  It's pretty much always a good idea to pick up a Smoke of Deceit
                  to send out on the courier with your Blink Dagger. Your first rotation
                  is definitely the most important moment of the game for a Sand King,
                  as it will set the tempo for your farming for the next 10 minutes
                  and gives you an idea of what kind of itemization you want to go for.
                  If you find that the first gank fails because your opponents are tanky,
                  you may want to go straight into a Veil or Dagon. If you die because
                  of enemy support rotations, you may want a Force Staff or Eul's next.
                  If you succeed in killing 1 or 2 major targets and everything goes
                  according to plan, Boots of Travel are the next purchase because they
                  allow you to keep the pressure up AND find farm all over the map.

                  After your first rotation you might even already have reached
                  level 9 if you were successful, but either way you now most likely
                  want to return to the lane you came from and keep farming. If you
                  see easy pickoffs across the map or both teams are doing lots
                  of fighting you likely want to be there instead, but as a Core Sand
                  King keeping up your farm is what sets you apart from a support,
                  and you'll farm considerably faster in lane than in the jungle.
                  Just make sure to keep a vigilant eye on the mini-map at this point,
                  as the fact that your lanes will have most likely collapsed means
                  that supports and gankers will be roaming potentially anywhere and
                  everywhere looking for opportunities to kill oblivious heroes
                  standing in lane.

                  Now that you have max Caustic, farming is that much easier
                  plus you stand to deal an absolute truckload of damage with your
                  Epicenter. Always keep in mind that you can potentially sting
                  a few creeps with Caustic after you Blink in and before
                  Burrow-stunning if there are no BKBs or heroes with mobility/defensive
                  spells that you're trying to target. The slow from Epicenter
                  helps with this too, just make sure you don't let anyone get
                  away before Epicenter pulses explode those creeps for you!

                  With level 2 Epicenter and maxed Caustic by level 11, this build
                  completely maximizes your damage potential at this point. Level 11
                  is an excellent timing for your first few aggressive pushes as a
                  team, taking perhaps any tier 1/2 towers that might be in your way
                  and Roshan. One good tip here in general is that Sand King is even
                  better at counter-initiating than initiating, so when you're playing
                  around an objective you can almost always afford to hang back, possibly
                  in the trees, looking for the perfect moment to strike. Be patient
                  with your first few Epicenters and you will be rewarded with an
                  unstoppable snowball.

                  The second point of Sand Storm and on are not really going to be
                  used for farming the jungle at this point so much as to allow you
                  to escape during teamfights and deal slightly more damage if you
                  get the chance to Sand Storm on top of your Epi. Ultimately the
                  damage from Sand Storm is slightly easier to get off in a teamfight
                  than that of Caustic, but you're much more likely to be able to
                  tap some creeps and casually catch enemy heroes with Caustic damage
                  in early game teamfights, which tend to be less chaotic and easier
                  to escape.
