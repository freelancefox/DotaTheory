    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Antares is a terrain-dependent agility carry that
      heavily relies on magical damage, thanks to his ultimate
      Kinetic Charge which increases his movement speed, agility
      and magic amplification the longer he moves without stopping.
      Thanks to his mount he can fly over ledges and cliffs while
      stunning enemies with Cliff Jump, summon a temporary plateau
      that deals damage with Eruption, and finish off fleeing enemies
      with his long-range nuke Sidewinder.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      A growing unrest was spreading across the Kingdom of Slom.
      Forests heaved and fauna scrambled for cover as if some wavelike
      disturbance swept forth, its epicenter at the Mount of Antares—a
      crag some ten leagues from Slom's once great capitol. After
      Karroch the Beastmaster freed the King's menagerie many winters
      ago, it was in that very capitol that the King himself was then
      struck by the Mad Scepter, and eventually ordered himself
      beheaded. Anticipating halcyon days ahead, the formerly-warlike
      kin of Slom had only just begun getting used to the idea of peace
      and quiet. Their unrest, however, was palpable. Like a black
      wave through her trees, carried on the wind, some force was
      causing all life in the land to behave... oddly. Animals became
      suddenly vicious, with reports of shepherds devoured by their own
      flocks. Even the vinters noted that their famous muscadine had
      turned dark, as if the land itself was poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people clamored for Karroch to investigate, but there was
      simply no way to reach the Beastmaster. Karroch had departed on a
      journey to find one particular beast, and told the people not
      to expect his return for many winters hence. As the season
      dragged on and foodstuffs depleted, the freemen of Slom began
      to lose hope. Starvation hit their youngest first, and yet
      from this hopelessness arose a new spark. One youngster, about
      the age that Karroch himself had been when he became a hero,
      decided to sojourn to the mount himself, hoping to learn this
      blight's cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boy summited the crag and looked out over the forests
      below, he saw something moving among the motionless landscape
      below. A magnificent stag suddenly lept forth from the canopy,
      scaling the mount's great height with a single jump. The boy
      could feel that it radiated forth some kind of power—an energy
      that runs counter to that of the darkness he had come there to
      defeat. The boy felt a strong connection to the stag—almost an
      invitation—and so hopped on its back to make the last leg of
      his journey. He nocked an arrow on the bow he had brought with
      him, and, hands quavering wildly, rounded the corner to see a
      shocking sight: Karroch's beast! After a silent moment the
      beast opened its eyes—crusted with a thick black film—and
      leered viciously at the boy. He heard a terrible rumbling voice
      in his head: "I am Antares," said the beast, telepathically.
      "Leave here or you and your Stag will be my next meal." Without
      any command by the boy, his mount began to charge the beast,
      and the boy knew what he must do. Hands steady at last, he
      loosed a spiraling shot at the beast—hitting it dead between
      the eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the boy could feel change, as suddenly the Mount
      started to crumble around him. Turning to leave, he heard the
      frenzied calls of a hawk from the corner of the cave grotto.
      Rushing over to investigate, the boy found Karroch, barely
      conscious, restrained behind the beast's throne, and with him
      his hawk. Though the boy was not sure how, he managed free the
      Beastmaster just in time for them both to escape. For the
      heroic rescue of his town, the boy was given the name Antares
      in honor of the evil he had vanquished; for the daring rescue
      of Karroch, the revelation that he had saved his own father.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A boy riding a magnificently large, noble stag. He wields a
      simple bow and wears garb similar to Beastmaster's, while the
      stag is orangey-red in hue and glows around his hooves, antlers
      and eyes. The boy, Antares, has donned the same face paint as
      Beastmaster, but lacks the horns and beard of his father. His
      stag has an elaborate pattern of zodiac-like constellations
      etched into its fur, which glow purple and give off a mist of
      increasingly brighter purple particles as Antares' passive
      Kinetic Charge gains energy.
