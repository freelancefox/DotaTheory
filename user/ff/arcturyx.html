    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Arcturyx is a new breed of agility carry, similar to others
      who rely on magic damage but eschewing physical damage nearly
      entirely with two main nukes that rely on stats and deal pure
      damage in the form of Ion Beam and Broadside respectively.  His
      kit also offers a supportive mobility skill, Arc Boost, which
      lets Arcturyx save allies or make dangerous dives of his own.
      His ultimate, Prismatic Wings, ties it all together by
      reflecting enemy spells and attacks while active, turning
      Arcturyx's health and mana pools into a giant Armlet-like
      battery that discharges and must then recharge.

    <p><i>"These memories are not my own. I must know—why?"</i></p>
    <p><i>"When they told me I was a prodigy... I didn't think they meant at killing."</i></p>
    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      Before he became Arcturyx, he was once a test subject in a
      secret Keen-folk weapons program, recruited as a child for
      displaying psychic abilities.  One day he woke up with amnesia,
      grafted to a machine and reborn as a sentient bird with
      firearms and futuristic military technology that deflects magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arcturyx's life was difficult from day one. He woke up on a
      burned battlefield, fallen from a passing airship—perhaps. Or,
      barely escaped from some far away mad scientist's coop. Or a
      weapon for some mad king. Either way, Arcturyx now longed for a
      roost, and decided to fly North.  Arcturyx flew over the
      Wailing Mountains, finding no suitable homestead there in the
      high craggy peaks, and so banked upward and into the clouds.
      Rising up to the levels of the highest snow-capped peaks,
      Arcturyx turned the corner around a hazy bank of ice clouds
      when WHAM a shot rang out in the distance. Quickly he soared
      toward the sound's source, when all of a sudden came into view
      the ramparts of a distant walled fortress, looming above a
      sheer drop some thousands of feet into the clouds below.
      Arcturyx peered through the clouds to where he spied some sort
      of engagement happening in the air above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zooming his view closer, Arcturyx identified what looked like
      several birds with similar armaments to his own: cannons and
      the like, encircling and attacking a convoy of airships
      protected by a flock of Buzz Copters. As Arcturyx approached
      quickly he realized he should enter the fray, but then paused.
      He couldn't even remember who these other birds were, or
      whether those ships they were attacking held innocent
      civilians—or untold treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arcturyx sailed past the sortie a first time, then caught an
      updraft and banked upward above the fracas. He peered down and
      wondered whether he was meant to be fighting those copters.
      Arcturyx certainly didn't want to any more. He wanted
      desperately to fight his own enemies, and find out who made
      him. He banked back towards the fortress and went looking for
      its owner. Though he found no resolution there in the fortress
      that day, Arcturyx would go on to recover scraps of his old
      life, thoughts reoccuring to him as dreams or flashes at odd
      moments. He was a boy once. He remembered the lab where they
      eventually bade him into a machine to fuse with the weapons
      system, and fragments of the experiments they put him through.
      Now he wants answers even more than before—the question is
      what he'll have to do to find them.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A biomechanical bird brought to life by a mad scientist. Huge
      steel-plated wings with crackling pads of energy that provide
      lift, and project a holographic field while Arcturyx's ultimate
      is active. Two main cannons on either shoulder remain at a 45
      degree angle to be used for firing Broadside cannon rounds to
      either side, and to fire its primary Ion Beam Arcturyx elongates
      its tail and opens its beak. Auto-attacks are yellow bolts of
      energy thrown from its wing-tips. Arc Boosted targets gain a trail
      of spiraling particles as they whoosh forward. Arcturyx's
      colorful plumage is not made from actual feathers but from
      yellow and magenta sparks as the wind and enemy attacks deflect
      off of his advanced armor.

          When first activated, Arcturyx temporarily reroutes more
          energy to reactive defenses, returning enemy attacks with
          one of his own, as well as blocking and returning a portion
          of damage from enemy spells. Drains health and mana while
          the active shields are on, up to a max duration or until
          the spell is activated again. When the active shields go
          down Arcturyx must charge to regain normal function and
          drops to the ground, reducing his movespeed to zero but
          regenerating health and mana at an increased rate. Arcturyx
          remains this way until he reaches full health again or max
          duration is reached, though he may still turn or maneuver
          with Arc Boost.

        <p><b>Discharge Health/Mana Drain</b>: 8/6/4% per second while

        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prematurely ending Prismatic Wings while Arc Boosted will
            override the Boost and make you stationary, but casting
            Arc Boost while recharging/immobile will properly grant
            you movement speed and turn speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The health drain from Prismatic Wings cannot be fatal
            to Arcturyx. The shield effect ends if Arcturyx's health
            or mana reaches zero.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ending the active shield effect early causes the remainder
            of the 80/60/40% total health and mana costs to be
            drained instantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            All reflected spell damage and self-damage from Prismatic
            Wings is magical, though the self-damage cannot be
            reduced by Prismatic Wings itself. This means it can,
            however, be reduced by magic resistance, blocked by BKB
            and reduced by Arc Boost.
