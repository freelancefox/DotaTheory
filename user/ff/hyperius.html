    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Hyperius is a heavy caster with a short attack range whose kit features
      defensive capabilities and mobility that set him apart from similar
      heroes. A unique bond with gravity grants Hyperius extreme control over
      his opponents' turn rates and ability to deal attack damage thanks to his
      ultimate Gravity Shards and sub-ability Gravity Well, which furthermore
      give Hyperius a unique resource to manage. Hyperius may choose to expend
      Shards for convenience and extra damage, but in doing so trades passive
      mana regen and evasion. Hyperius's prowess as a magus is well known, yet
      what he lacks in direct damage he makes up for through prolonging fights
      thanks to his self-healing nuke Plasma Burst and supportive third skill,
      Null Shield, which grants spell block. Last but not least, Hyperius's
      main teamfight contribution is undoubtedly his channeled, vector-targeted
      variable-radius AoE stun, Solar Storm. What Solar Storm lacks in stun
      duration it makes up for in its versatility, with the ability to fire off
      a smaller, faster Invoker-Tornado-like projectile that chases enemies
      dealing damage over time while also being able to cover an entire
      teamfight with a gigantic storm if channeled long enough.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      Originally from a dimension where consciousness is not born but rather
      discovered, Hyperius stands out among the heroes who defend ancients as a
      being of both extreme intellect and dramatic contradiction. While he
      began life as a bodyless impulse dreamt up by the Solar Goddess, Hyperius
      soon realized that to serve his mistress would require a suitable
      physical manifestation—something designed for combat against other beings
      like himself—and so sought out the gadgeteer Hephaestus in his Celestial
      Forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep into the volcanic workshop Hyperius delved seeking an artifice to
      his liking, past automaton after augmented suit of armor, deeper and
      deeper into the mine's hellish lower branches until reaching the end of
      his presented options. Coming to the edge of the liquid-metal mantle,
      glowing burning white and hot, Hyperius kept going—by accident or perhaps
      out of curiousity. Allowing himself to be drawn in to the ultra-dense
      solar core, Hyperius's soul fused with the living energy of the star. In
      the ensuing reaction, a new and perfect body formed, cast out of a molten
      metal unlike anything to come before it or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      His solar-forged body may appear mortal, but in our reality Hyperius
      wields the same power as he did before as a bodyless force whose job was
      to hold the universe together—his shoulders, like the many bodies that
      hang from that dark framework, bear the weight of all worlds as if
      Hyperius was a great keystone holding up the sky. It is this aspect of
      Hyperius's nature that enables his current form to control gravity with
      such precision—equally as capable of movements galactic in scale as those
      local in scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venturing in service of the Solar Goddess to the cities of men on many an
      occasion, Hyperius's encounters with various magi were nothing short of
      spectacular. Hyperius's affinity for cosmic balance is equally matched by
      his unwitting penchant for destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now tasked with maintaining the balance between radiant and dire,
      Hyperius voyages with begrudging loyalty to trifle with mortal
      matters—and magi—once more. With infinite worlds hanging in the balance,
      Hyperius serves the very notion of existence as both a bastion against
      chaos and an arbiter of divine judgment.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A magus with glowing metallic skin. Controls floating black
      diamond-shaped chunks of dark matter similar to Invoker's orbs. Light
      green and cyan bursts of plasma accompany Hyperius's non-ultimate spells,
      while his signature Gravity Wells appear like flattened mini-Black Holes
      that stretch enemies between dimensions. His Gravity Shards rotate
      clockwise and glow brightly while generating shards, and instead rotate
      counter-clockwise and absorb light while consuming shards.

        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The bolt bounces to the nearest target first and has no maximum
            bounce range, but may only bounce to enemies who were in the target
            area and received the Bolt Target buff on cast (visible to all
            players above the targeted enemy's heads like Ember's Sleight of
            Fist effect, may only hit each enemy once). Enemies who travel more
            than 1,000 units after the Bolt Target buff is placed on them are
            removed from the bolt's target list.
          </li>
          <li>
            The secondary blast happens at the end of the bolt's duration or
            upon running out of targets to bounce to. Any enemies the bolt was
            unable to bounce to before bursting do not take the bounce damage or
            give healing to Hyperius.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bolt always heals the listed amount of damage regardless of how
            much damage is dealt, and may not bounce to invisible or spell
            immune enemies. Invisible enemies may be hit by the blast.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are no visible targets in the cone on cast, the bolt
            travels straight for a distance equal to the cast range and then
            bursts.

            After channeling for the base duration, activate W again to end the
            channeling and release the storm at its current size. If Hyperius
            is stunned before the base channeling duration is reached, the
            storm dissipates and the ability goes on cooldown.

            The storm's eye destroys trees it passes over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once locked on to a hero, the storm attempts to match the speed and
            direction of the target until the duration ends, unless the storm
            is given a move order or the storm's 'Q' ability is activated,
            which resets the storm's aggro and allows the storm to pick a new
            target. If the current target dies or leaves the radius, or after
            its aggro is reset, the storm continues along its original vector.
            The storm has flying movement, but provides no vision and may not
            go above its original starting speed (similar to a Wildkin
            Cyclone).

          Gravity Wells now deal magical damage over time (100/125/150 dps), and
          increases the limit for maximum number of Wells at a time. Manually
          casting a Gravity Well (by activating D) causes that Well to slowly
          drag enemies towards its center.

        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The effects of multiple Gravity Wells do not stack, and the effects
            do not linger after leaving its radius.
          </li>
          <li>
            Casting Gravity Well cannot generate a Gravity Shard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Casting Gravity Well while in Gravity Shard consumption mode costs
            1 shard and gains spell amp/cooldown reduction. Casting Gravity
            Well while in Gravity Shard generation mode requires 1 shard to
            cast and does not generate a shard or benefit from spell
            amp/cooldown reduction.

      </li>
      <li>
        Cast time improved from 0.4 + 0.35s to 0.3 + 0.45s
      </li>
      <li>
        Renamed Miasma to Solar Storm
      </li>
      <li>
        Renamed Void Shield to Null Shield
      </li>
      <li>
        Null Shield reworked to no longer consider nearby allies for triggering
        the secondary effect, and instead also triggers when the target ally
        casts a spell
      </li>
      <li>
        Null Shield's spell amplification component is now enabled by
        purchasing Aghanim's Shard, also causing the secondary effect to apply
        a basic dispel to nearby enemies
      </li>
      <li>
        Gravity Shards now constantly provide their passive bonuses, rather
        than just while generation mode is toggled on
      </li>

        Gravity Shards mana regen per shard increased from scaling 0.9/1.2/1.5
        to static 1.5 per shard
      </li>
      <li>
        Gravity Shard consumption now also provides 8/16/24% spell
        amplification (only effects Hyperius's spells, like the cooldown
        reduction)
      </li>
      <li>

        rather than unspecific 'Sun God'

        Gravity Shards give mana regen and evasion while generating shards and
        cooldown reduction/channeling speed increase for spells while consuming
      </li>
