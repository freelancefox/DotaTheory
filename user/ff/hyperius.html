    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Hyperius is a heavy caster with a short attack range, but his kit features
      defensive capabilities and mobility that set him apart from other similar
      heroes. A unique bond with gravity grants Hyperius extreme control over
      his opponents' turn rates and their ability to deal physical damage,
      thanks to his ultimate Gravity Shards and sub-ability Gravity Well, which
      furthermore give Hyperius a unique resource to manage in the form of his
      Invoker-like floating orbs. Hyperius may choose to expend Shards for
      convenience and speed, but in doing so trades passive mana regen and
      evasion. Hyperius's prowess as a magus is well known, yet what he lacks in
      direct damage he makes up for through prolonging fights thanks to his
      self-healing nuke Plasma Burst and supportive third skill, Void Shield,
      which grants spell block while amping spell damage.  Last but not least,
      Hyperius's main teamfight contribution is undoubtedly his channeled,
      vector-targeted variable-radius AoE stun, Miasma.  What Miasma lacks in
      stun duration, it makes up for in its versatility, with the ability to
      fire off a smaller, faster Invoker-Tornado-like projectile that chases
      enemies dealing damage over time, while simultaneously being able to cover
      an entire teamfight with a large storm if channeled long enough.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      Originally from a dimension where consciousness is not born but rather
      discovered, Hyperius stands out among the heroes who defend ancients as a
      being of both extreme intellect and dramatic contradiction. While he began
      life as a bodyless impulse dreamt up by the Sun God, Hyperius soon
      realized that to serve his master would require a suitable physical
      manifestation—something designed for combat against other beings like
      himself—and so sought out the gadgeteer Hephaestus in his Celestial Forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep into the volcanic workshop Hyperius delved seeking an artifice to his
      liking, past automaton after augmented suit of armor, deeper and deeper
      into the mine's hellish lower branches until reaching the end of his
      presented options. Coming to the edge of the liquid-metal mantle, glowing
      burning white and hot, Hyperius kept going—by accident or perhaps out of
      curiousity. Allowing himself to be drawn in to the ultra-dense solar core,
      Hyperius's soul instantly fused with the living energy of the star. In the
      ensuing reaction, a new and perfect body formed, cast out of a molten
      metal unlike anything to come before it or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      His solar-forged body may appear mortal, but in our reality Hyperius
      wields the same power in this form as he did before as a bodyless force
      whose job was to hold the universe together—his shoulders, like the many
      bodies that hang from that dark framework, bear the weight of all worlds
      as if Hyperius was a great keystone holding up the sky. It is this part of
      Hyperius's nature that enables his current form to control gravity with
      such precision—equally as capable of movements galactic in scale as those
      local in scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venturing in service of the Sun God to the cities of men on many an
      occasion, Hyperius's encounters with various magi were nothing short of
      spectacular. Hyperius's affinity for cosmic balance is equally matched by
      his unwitting penchant for destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now tasked with maintaining the balance between radiant and dire, Hyperius
      voyages with begrudging loyalty to trifle with mortal matters—and
      magi—once more. With infinite worlds hanging in the balance, Hyperius
      serves the very notion of existence as both a bastion against chaos and an
      arbiter of divine judgment.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A magus-like figure with glowing metallic skin and black diamond-shaped
      floating orbs similar to Invoker's. Light green and cyan bursts of plasma
      accompany Hyperius's first two spells, while his signature Gravity Wells
      appear like flattened mini-Black Holes that stretch enemies between
      dimensions.

        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The bolt bounces to the nearest target first and has no maximum
            bounce range, but may only bounce to enemies who were in the target
            area and received the Bolt Target buff on cast (visible to all
            players above the targeted enemy's heads like Ember's Sleight of
            Fist effect, may only hit each enemy once). Enemies who travel more
            than 1,000 units after the Bolt Target buff is placed on them are
            removed from the bolt's target list.
          </li>
          <li>
            The secondary blast happens at the end of the bolt's duration or
            upon running out of targets to bounce to. Any enemies the bolt was
            unable to bounce to before bursting do not take the bounce damage or
            give healing to Hyperius.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bolt always heals the listed amount of damage regardless of how
            much damage is dealt, and may not bounce to spell immune enemies.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are no visible targets in the cone on cast, the bolt
            travels straight for a distance equal to the cast range and then
            bursts.

            pick a new target. If the current target dies or leaves the radius,
            the storm continues along its original vector. The storm has flying

          Gravity Wells now deal magical damage over time (100/125/150 dps), and
          increases the limit for maximum number of Wells at a time. Manually
          casting a Gravity Well (by activating D) causes that Well to slowly
          drag enemies towards its center.

        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When the maximum Gravity Well limit is exceeded, the oldest one disappears.
          </li>
          <li>
            The effects of multiple Gravity Wells do not stack, and the Wells'
            effects do not linger after leaving its radius.

          <li>
            Aghanim's upgraded and manually-casted aghs upgraded Gravity Wells
            have different visual appearances, with a brighter more colorful
            center and shimmering/rotation effect respectively.
