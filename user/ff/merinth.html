    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Merinth Tracker is a unique blend of greed and intellect, able
      to farm swiftly thanks to a percentage gold boost from kills he
      gets with his stun Harpoon, all the while zipping around the
      map thanks to his signature mobiliy spell, Hydroplane, which
      grants him incredible movement speed in the river or wherever
      his first spell, Water Sprite, has gone first. Merinth's unique
      role as a melee intelligence carry comes from his skills as a
      tracker, wielding an extra-long melee attack range, the aura
      provided by his Sprite, which grants up to 50% lifesteal on all
      damage including spells, and lastly his ultimate, Mana Wave,
      which allows Merinth to restore allied mana while burning it
      from enemies.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      Some sea monsters are simply not meant to be caught. Or so they
      once said of the greatest sea terror ever, the dastardly whelk
      Proteus. Well, they were wrong. It takes a special breed of
      hunter—one with patience, cunning, AND that rare trait of
      tenacity—but eventually Sulliver managed to track down and
      nearly kill the twelve oceans' most-sought-after sea-beastie.
      His harpoon was mere inches from the beast's mantle when he
      felt a pang of sadness—remorse, even. He almost felt bad for
      the bloke, for just one second. You see, after spending so
      many sleepless nights haunting around reefs chasing someone—mer
      or monster or otherwise—you almost feel like he (or it, I
      suppose) becomes a part of you. A wee part of you. And it was
      that moment of hesitation that let the biggest prize he would
      have ever taken down escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that day, Sulliver the Merinth Tracker has taken pride in
      never letting a single mark escape. Driven by greed and the
      thrill of the hunt, he'll hunt anything from convicts to
      sea-creatures if the prize is large enough. With uncanny
      timing, startling agility and his trademark technique of slowly
      sapping his enemy's power, the Merinth Tracker can and will
      chase down any foe.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      Scaley male naga with lanky form, tall headpiece, tribal beads
      and garb, shoulder guard, armored belt, and a long
      trident-tipped flexible spear. Algae and barnacles cover his
      shell armor. His dominant arm is a large crab claw, while he
      wields his spear with his normal naga hand. Runs with his crab
      legs but pulls them inside his shell and rides a small wave
      while hydroplaning.
