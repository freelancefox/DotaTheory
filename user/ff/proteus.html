    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Proteus is a fast-paced support hero whose abilities allow it
      to quickly get in and out of combat, using Jet, while also
      repositioning allies or enemies with Razorwind and providing burst
      damage or a damage shield with Polyp. Proteus's ultimate,
      Rarefaction, grants reduced non-ultimate cooldowns to allies
      nearby, making Proteus a useful pick in strategies that involve
      grouping up and teamfighting.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      As Maelrawn's tentacle was lopped off by Admiral Kunkka, she
      screamed in agony and, enraged, discarded the appendage to
      settle to the barren sea floor. Forgotten as quickly as a
      replacement grew in, the flesh slowly decayed amongst the ocean
      detritus. Some spark still coursed through those veins
      though—an immense life force by any standard—and after many
      monsoon seasons the limb erupted in a fit of growth; the beast
      called Proteus emerged, renewed, from its preserved state.
      Knowing only its current form, but aware that it had barely
      survived some ordeal, Proteus was now aware of its own
      mortality and was thus determined to survive in this unfamiliar
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proteus's wanderings began innocently, but quickly turned to
      fear and pain. The benevolent beast terrified all that it came
      across, and, as legend of this sea monster spread from sandy
      shore to deep city, both man and mer mounted hunting parties to
      eradicate Proteus, for prize and glory. No harbor was safe as
      the Merinth trackers and Claddish treasure fleet chased poor
      Proteus, weaving through knotted mangroves and blackest
      trenches. Cornered at last in an alcove along the Redwater
      Reef, Proteus foresaw its own doom. As the harpoons arced down,
      meant to puncture its mantle and kill Maelrawn's sole
      offspring, something happened. Involuntarily, Proteus awakened
      its most powerful reflex—its survival instinct. With one
      massive blast of water, the murderous host went surging
      downward, drowned, while Proteus went soaring above the ocean
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      With new power coursing through its veins, Proteus now
      understood its purpose in life and so emerged from the quiet
      sea to find the source of its life force. On a journey now to
      find its mother Maelrawn, Proteus crosses land and sea unafraid
      and unstoppable.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A serpentine sea monster whose appearance is that of a vast
      octopus, floating above the ground using its jets for
      propulsion and its tentacles to strike. Its attack animation is
      a slash with one of the front two tentacles, which sends out a
      blade-shaped bit of wind. Its skin is covered with mysterious
      patterns of deep blue dapples and cyan veins that course with
      power, while its eyes and the aura from its ultimate glow a
      bright ember orange. (<i>Everything about the hero is
      intentionally genderless but I anticipate it being voiced by a
      female and most often referred to as female</i>)

          full. The Polyp remains for a duration, until killed or

      <div class="row notes">
        <h5>Notes:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Polyps are indicated visually by an additional light blue
            health bar over the target, as well as the model of a
            Polyp hovering above the target.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polyps do not stack with each other, unless the level 25
            talent is taken. Casting a second Polyp on an ally has no
            effect (unless the Polyp's health was at less than its
            base health or had stopped regenerating, at which point
            the new Polyp will override) but still puts the spell on
            cooldown. The level 25 talent prioritizes putting 1 Polyp
            per ally if there's more than one within range, but can
            put 2 Polyps on a single target if no other heroes
            (including yourself) are in range and have less total
            combined Polyp health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polyp damage does not work on buildings, but the buff and
            damage are NOT expended if the host attacks a structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            At level 1, Proteus can place up to 2 Polyps on allies
            and use them to deal maximum damage during a 12 second
            window where they're both fully charged. With levels 2,
            3 and 4 Polyp this increases to 3 max Polyps in an 8s
            window, 4 max Polyps in a 13s window, and 5 max Polyps
            in a 12s window respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            With level 3 ultimate, Proteus can extend this window up
            to 28s, although the Polyps lose their ability to regenerate
            health upon reaching full capacity. With the level 25
            Polyp regen talent and an Octarine core, the window
            can reach up to 37.66s.

      <li>Updated Polyp wording</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Update Polyp base health scaling from 50 to 50/75/100/125,
        Polyp max health from 150/250/350/450 to 150/225/300/375, and

      <li>Rarefaction bonus damage taken decreased from 40% to 33%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>v2.0 (Nov 2015):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Updated Polyp mechanism: *previously* used to block no damage
        and accumulate slowly until the host attacks or being knocked
        off by attacking the host a fixed number of times, *now* the
        polyp's health is used to prevent incoming damage or be
        expended as a single burst of damage, and the polyp constantly
        regens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduced Polyp cast range from 1200 to 800, and restored old
        mana/cooldown values
      </li>
      <li>
        Reverted experimental Jet changes, and increased Jet
        distance from 250/300/350/400 to 240/360/480/600
      </li>
      <li>
        Increased Rarefaction bonus damage taken from 20% to 40%,
        and added scaling aura radius from 900 to 900/1200/1500.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>v1.21 (Sept 2013):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adjust Jet to now apply a strong dispel to allies Proteus
        passes through, as opposed to Proteus being able to cast it
        while CCed. Also increase cooldown and increase manacost to
        compensate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reworked Polyp to scale from 1 attack to 1/1/2/3 attacks, and
