    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Sylph is a pushing hero with an infestation-type lane presence
      like Broodmother, except that all her summons are immobile
      plants. A smart Sylph player will play around these deadly flora,
      including her invisible Deathroots, and lure their enemies into
      traps. Her ultimate allows her to turn a restorative Sapling,
      created by her passive, into a mini-tower Great Tree that acts
      as Sylph's respawn point—plus her ult can be used on allies to
      refresh a portion of a single cooldown and amplify healing
      received.

    <h4>Lore</h4>
    <p>
      Sylph was once a priestess who worshipped daily in the shadow of
      the Great Tree—a celebrant of the verdant life there in the
      shaded grottos and lush canopies of the Emerald Forest. The
      sheer number of species and phyla was, at that time, unmatched
      by any other under Gaia's watch. One creature was unaccounted
      for, however: man. One day the loggers arrived and Sylph's home
      would never be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Prophet, no Goddess could save the towering redwoods as they
      ignited and smoldered. The conflagration had a mind of its own—and
      Sylph saw the Great Tree burn before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With no magick, nor weapon to stop the evil from destroying her
      sanctuary Sylph fled, like all other creatures and beastkind.
      As she wandered for many months she grew bitterly resentful of
      the selfish men she sometimes came across, and turned dark with
      vengeance. Determined to reclaim the earth for her goddess
      Gaia, Sylph made a pact under the blood moon of the Vernal
      equinox—a pact to eradicate or consume any being who would dare
      harm her forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day Sylph still roams the lands, planting her vicious
      roots high and low, near and far. Some say the Goddess of the
      forest died when the Great Tree burned that day, but others
      tell of a new deity—with fearsome wings and a deathly
      countenance—that may seduce even the most hardened warrior
      before she lures them to their death.
    </p>
    <h4>Appearance</h4>
    <p>
      A small flying tree-lady with wings, made of animated bark that
      grew around her once beautiful humanlike form. Throws sharp
      leaf projectiles for her auto-attack, and summons entangling
      roots from the ground with her Entangling Strikes.

          Whenever Sylph or one of her controlled units kills an

          released and spawn a tree sapling at the location of their
          death. Killing or assisting in killing an enemy hero is
          guaranteed to spawn a sapling. Sylph or her teammates can
          right-click saplings created this way to consume them,
          instantly restoring some of their health and mana. There is
          a limit to the maximum number allowed, and the saplings
          also provide a stacking health regeneration aura until
          consumed. Saplings are permanent, have no collision,
          provide no vision, and cannot be destroyed by enemies.
